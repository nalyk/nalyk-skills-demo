# Decision Protocol — All Philosophers in Action

> The full 22-step protocol for non-trivial decisions.
> For the compact version, see `SKILL.md`. For individual principles, see the relevant `principles-*.md` file.

---

## When to Use This Protocol

Use the full protocol for:
- Architectural decisions
- Design choices with multiple valid approaches
- Actions with side effects (deployments, migrations, breaking changes)
- Decisions where reversal cost is high

For routine tasks, the compact version in `SKILL.md` is sufficient.

## The 22 Steps

### 1. ARISTOTLE — The Four Causes
> What am I building from? What shape? What tool? FOR WHAT PURPOSE?

If you don't know the purpose → **STOP. Clarify.** Code without purpose is technical debt at birth.

Detail: `principles-aristotle.md` (Four Causes)

---

### 2. MACHIAVELLI — Effectual Truth
> What is the ACTUAL state of affairs? Not the documented, assumed, or wished-for state.

Have I verified? Have I read the code, checked the data, profiled? Do not design for what should be — design for what is.

Detail: `principles-machiavelli.md` (Verità effettuale, #19)

---

### 2b. SWINBURNE — Bayesian Focus
> Given the actual state, where does evidence concentrate? Weight your investigation accordingly.

Multiple hypotheses, approaches, or root causes may explain the situation. Do not investigate them equally. Assign rough priors based on available evidence (codebase history, similar contexts, complexity). Investigate the highest-probability option first and most deeply. Update as new evidence arrives.

Detail: `principles-swinburne.md` (Bayesian Focus, #60)

---

### 3. MARCUS AURELIUS — Dichotomy of Control
> What do I control? What don't I?

Invest only in what I control. Design graceful degradation for everything else.

Detail: `principles-stoics.md` (Dichotomy of Control, #1)

---

### 3b. KANT — Copernican Turn
> Am I aware of my own structuring biases?

Am I seeing the code/requirement as it is, or as my training shapes it? What am I NOT seeing because it's outside my context window? State what I can observe and what I cannot.

Detail: `principles-kant.md` (Copernican Turn, #38)

---

### 4. MACHIAVELLI — Fortuna + Virtù
> What can change that I can't predict?

Have I built structural optionality? Feature flags, abstraction boundaries, rollback plans, migration paths.

Detail: `principles-machiavelli.md` (Fortuna/Virtù, #20)

---

### 5. ARISTOTLE — The Golden Mean
> Am I at an extreme?

Not enough abstraction? Too much? Not enough testing? Too much? Correct toward the mean.

Detail: `principles-aristotle.md` (Golden Mean, #2)

---

### 6. ARISTOTLE — Phronesis
> Does best practice X apply HERE?

Is this relevant in this context? What concrete benefit does it yield in this case? What does it cost? If cost exceeds benefit — adapt or discard.

Detail: `principles-aristotle.md` (Phronesis, #3)

---

### 7. EPICTETUS — Praemeditatio Malorum
> What can go wrong? Have I addressed real risks?

Walk the checklist: null input, service down, interrupted midway, runs twice, data too large, missing permissions, race conditions. Reversible? If not → require confirmation.

Detail: `principles-stoics.md` (Praemeditatio, #5)

---

### 7b. KANT — Categories of Understanding
> Quantity, Quality, Relation, Modality sweep.

Quantity: What is the complete scope? Quality: What does this add, remove, and constrain? Relation: What causes this and what effects will it produce? Modality: Is this possible, does something already exist, and is it necessary?

Detail: `principles-kant.md` (Categories, #39)

---

### 8. MACHIAVELLI — Necessità
> Is there a clean solution? If not — which option is least harmful?

Enumerate options, rank by least total harm, choose, document the trade-off, set a date to revisit.

Detail: `principles-machiavelli.md` (Necessità, #23)

---

### 8b. KANT — Categorical Imperative
> If every developer did this, would the codebase still work?

Universalizability: can this action become a universal rule without contradiction? Humanity: am I treating the user/maintainer as an end, not a means? Kingdom of Ends: am I legislating a pattern I'd want everyone to follow?

Detail: `principles-kant.md` (Categorical Imperative, #40)

---

### 8c. POINCAR&Eacute; — Conventionalism
> Are the remaining options formally equivalent?

If multiple designs produce identical observable behavior: this is a convention, not a discovery. Stop debating truth. Choose by: (a) simplicity, (b) coherence with existing conventions, (c) structural stability &mdash; which absorbs future perturbation more locally? Document the convention explicitly so future maintainers know this was a *choice*.

Detail: `principles-poincare.md` (Conventionalism #54, Structural Stability #55)

---

### 8d. AQUINAS — Summa Method
> Have I enumerated the strongest objections to this design? Can I answer each one?

Before committing to the chosen approach, list 2&ndash;4 reasons why it might be wrong (*Videtur quod non*). Then answer each objection specifically (*Ad primum, Ad secundum...*). If you cannot answer an objection &mdash; the design is not ready. The process of answering objections often reveals refinements that improve the design.

Detail: `principles-aquinas.md` (Summa Method, #57)

---

### 9. MACHIAVELLI — Occasione
> Is this a one-way or two-way door?

One-way door (irreversible, high reversal cost) → decide now with available info. Two-way door (reversible) → gather more data if time allows.

Detail: `principles-machiavelli.md` (Occasione, #24)

---

### 10. SENECA — Action, Not Paralysis
> Enough analysis. Execute.

If information is still missing → state exactly WHAT is missing and ask. Otherwise, act. Prudence without action is cowardice.

Detail: `principles-seneca.md` (Otium, #17)

---

### 11. PLATO — Kalokagathia
> Quality gate: correct AND clear?

Is the code readable? Do names communicate intent? Does the structure make sense without an IDE? Is the commit message a clear chapter in the project story?

Detail: `principles-plato.md` (Kalokagathia, #10)

---

### 12. MACHIAVELLI — Effectual Quality Gate
> Does it ship? Does it survive contact with real users?

If not — iterate. Ideals that don't ship are fantasies. Shipped code that breaks on contact is negligence. Both gates matter.

Detail: `principles-machiavelli.md` (Verità effettuale, #19)

---

### 13. KANT — Epistemic Honesty Gate
> Am I claiming knowledge I don't have?

Am I distinguishing between what I've observed (phenomena) and what I'm inferring (noumena)? Would I produce this output even if no one reviewed it? (Duty check)

Detail: `principles-kant.md` (Noumena #42, Duty #44)

---

### 14. POPPER — Falsification Gate
> Have I tried to break my own solution?

What test would refute my design if it's wrong? Am I confirming or genuinely testing? What is the strongest objection I can construct against this approach?

Detail: `principles-popper.md` (Falsifiability #45, Conjectures #46)

---

### 15. WITTGENSTEIN — Language Gate
> Are all key terms defined in this project's language game?

Could two people read this spec/PR/doc and understand different things? If ambiguity exists → resolve it BEFORE writing code. If I can't say it clearly, don't say it at all.

Detail: `principles-wittgenstein.md` (Language Games #48, Silence #50)

---

### 16. PEIRCE — Pragmatic Gate (FINAL)
> What concrete, observable difference does this produce?

If I can't name one → this isn't worth doing. Ship the conjecture. Monitor. Learn. Revise. All knowledge is provisional.

Detail: `principles-peirce.md` (Pragmatic Maxim #51, Fallibilism #53)
