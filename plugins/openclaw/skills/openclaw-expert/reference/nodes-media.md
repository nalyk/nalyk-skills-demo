Audio / Voice Notes — 2026-01-17
What works
Media understanding (audio)
: If audio understanding is enabled (or auto‑detected), OpenClaw:
Locates the first audio attachment (local path or URL) and downloads it if needed.
Enforces
maxBytes
before sending to each model entry.
Runs the first eligible model entry in order (provider or CLI).
If it fails or skips (size/timeout), it tries the next entry.
On success, it replaces
Body
with an
[Audio]
block and sets
{{Transcript}}
Command parsing
: When transcription succeeds,
CommandBody
RawBody
are set to the transcript so slash commands still work.
Verbose logging
: In
--verbose
, we log when transcription runs and when it replaces the body.
Auto-detection (default)
If you
don’t configure models
and
tools.media.audio.enabled
not
set to
false
OpenClaw auto-detects in this order and stops at the first working option:
Local CLIs
(if installed)
sherpa-onnx-offline
(requires
SHERPA_ONNX_MODEL_DIR
with encoder/decoder/joiner/tokens)
whisper-cli
(from
whisper-cpp
; uses
WHISPER_CPP_MODEL
or the bundled tiny model)
whisper
(Python CLI; downloads models automatically)
Gemini CLI
gemini
) using
read_many_files
Provider keys
(OpenAI → Groq → Deepgram → Google)
To disable auto-detection, set
tools.media.audio.enabled: false
To customize, set
tools.media.audio.models
Note: Binary detection is best-effort across macOS/Linux/Windows; ensure the CLI is on
PATH
(we expand
), or set an explicit CLI model with a full command path.

Deepgram (audio transcription)
Audio providers can override
baseUrl
headers
, and
providerOptions
via
tools.media.audio
Default size cap is 20MB (
tools.media.audio.maxBytes
). Oversize audio is skipped for that model and the next entry is tried.
Default
maxChars
for audio is
unset
(full transcript). Set
tools.media.audio.maxChars
or per-entry
maxChars
to trim output.
OpenAI auto default is
gpt-4o-mini-transcribe
; set
model: &quot;gpt-4o-transcribe&quot;
for higher accuracy.
Use
tools.media.audio.attachments
to process multiple voice notes (
mode: &quot;all&quot;
maxAttachments
Transcript is available to templates as
{{Transcript}}
CLI stdout is capped (5MB); keep CLI output concise.
Mention Detection in Groups
When
requireMention: true
is set for a group chat, OpenClaw now transcribes audio
before
checking for mentions. This allows voice notes to be processed even when they contain mentions.
How it works:
If a voice message has no text body and the group requires mentions, OpenClaw performs a “preflight” transcription.
The transcript is checked for mention patterns (e.g.,
@BotName
, emoji triggers).
If a mention is found, the message proceeds through the full reply pipeline.
The transcript is used for mention detection so voice notes can pass the mention gate.
Fallback behavior:
If transcription fails during preflight (timeout, API error, etc.), the message is processed based on text-only mention detection.
This ensures that mixed messages (text + audio) are never incorrectly dropped.
Example:
A user sends a voice note saying “Hey @Claude, what’s the weather?” in a Telegram group with
requireMention: true
. The voice note is transcribed, the mention is detected, and the agent replies.
Gotchas
Scope rules use first-match wins.
chatType
is normalized to
direct
group
, or
room
Ensure your CLI exits 0 and prints plain text; JSON needs to be massaged via
jq -r .text
Keep timeouts reasonable (
timeoutSeconds
, default 60s) to avoid blocking the reply queue.
Preflight transcription only processes the
first
audio attachment for mention detection. Additional audio is processed during the main media understanding phase.

CLI helper (temp files + MEDIA)
The easiest way to get attachments is via the CLI helper, which writes decoded media to a temp file and prints
MEDIA:&lt;path&gt;
Examples:
Copy
openclaw
nodes
camera
snap
--node
&lt;
&gt;
# default: both front + back (2 MEDIA lines)
openclaw

Notes:
nodes camera snap
defaults to

facings to give the agent both views.
Output files are temporary (in the OS temp directory) unless you build your own wrapper.
Android node
Android user setting (default on)
Android Settings sheet →
Camera
Allow Camera
camera.enabled
Default:
(missing key is treated as enabled).
When off:
camera.*
commands return
CAMERA_DISABLED
Permissions
Android requires runtime permissions:
CAMERA
for both
camera.snap
and
camera.clip
RECORD_AUDIO
for
camera.clip
when
includeAudio=true
If permissions are missing, the app will prompt when possible; if denied,
camera.*
requests fail with a
*_PERMISSION_REQUIRED
error.
Android foreground requirement
Like
canvas.*
, the Android node only allows
camera.*
commands in the
foreground
. Background invocations return
NODE_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE
Payload guard
Photos are recompressed to keep the base64 payload under 5 MB.
macOS app
User setting (default off)
The macOS companion app exposes a checkbox:
Settings → General → Allow Camera
openclaw.cameraEnabled
Default:
off
When off: camera requests return “Camera disabled by user”.
CLI helper (node invoke)
Use the main
openclaw
CLI to invoke camera commands on the macOS node.
Examples:
Copy
openclaw
nodes
camera
list
--node
&lt;
&gt;
# list camera ids
openclaw

&lt;
&gt;
openclaw
nodes
camera
clip
--node
&lt;
&gt;
--no-audio
Notes:
openclaw nodes camera snap
defaults to
maxWidth=1600
unless overridden.
On macOS,
camera.snap
waits
delayMs
(default 2000ms) after warm-up/exposure settle before capturing.
Photo payloads are recompressed to keep base64 under 5 MB.
Safety + practical limits
Camera and microphone access trigger the usual OS permission prompts (and require usage strings in Info.plist).
Video clips are capped (currently
&lt;= 60s
) to avoid oversized node payloads (base64 overhead + message limits).
macOS screen video (OS-level)
For
screen
video (not camera), use the macOS companion:
Copy
openclaw
nodes
screen
record
--node
&lt;
&gt;
--duration
10s
--fps
# prints MEDIA:&lt;path&gt;
Notes:
Requires macOS
Screen Recording
permission (TCC).

Image &amp; Media Support — 2025-12-05
The WhatsApp channel runs via
Baileys Web
. This document captures the current media handling rules for send, gateway, and agent replies.
Goals
Send media with optional captions via
openclaw message send --media
Allow auto-replies from the web inbox to include media alongside text.
Keep per-type limits sane and predictable.
CLI Surface
openclaw message send --media &lt;path-or-url&gt; [--message &lt;caption&gt;]
--media
optional; caption can be empty for media-only sends.
--dry-run
prints the resolved payload;
--json
emits
{ channel, to, messageId, mediaUrl, caption }
WhatsApp Web channel behavior
Input: local file path
HTTP(S) URL.
Flow: load into a Buffer, detect media kind, and build the correct payload:
Images:
resize &amp; recompress to JPEG (max side 2048px) targeting
agents.defaults.mediaMaxMb
(default 5 MB), capped at 6 MB.
Audio/Voice/Video:
pass-through up to 16 MB; audio is sent as a voice note (
ptt: true
Documents:
anything else, up to 100 MB, with filename preserved when available.
WhatsApp GIF-style playback: send an MP4 with
gifPlayback: true
(CLI:
--gif-playback
) so mobile clients loop inline.
MIME detection prefers magic bytes, then headers, then file extension.
Caption comes from
--message
reply.text
; empty caption is allowed.
Logging: non-verbose shows
; verbose includes size and source path/URL.
Auto-Reply Pipeline
getReplyFromConfig
returns
{ text?, mediaUrl?, mediaUrls? }
When media is present, the web sender resolves local paths or URLs using the same pipeline as
openclaw message send
Multiple media entries are sent sequentially if provided.
Inbound Media to Commands (Pi)
When inbound web messages include media, OpenClaw downloads to a temp file and exposes templating variables:
{{MediaUrl}}
pseudo-URL for the inbound media.
{{MediaPath}}
local temp path written before running the command.
When a per-session Docker sandbox is enabled, inbound media is copied into the sandbox workspace and
MediaPath
MediaUrl
are rewritten to a relative path like
media/inbound/&lt;filename&gt;
Media understanding (if configured via
tools.media.*
or shared
tools.media.models
) runs before templating and can insert
[Image]
[Audio]
, and
[Video]
blocks into
Body
Audio sets
{{Transcript}}
and uses the transcript for command parsing so slash commands still work.
Video and image descriptions preserve any caption text for command parsing.
By default only the first matching image/audio/video attachment is processed; set
tools.media.&lt;cap&gt;.attachments
to process multiple attachments.
Limits &amp; Errors
Outbound send caps (WhatsApp web send)
Images: ~6 MB cap after recompression.
Audio/voice/video: 16 MB cap; documents: 100 MB cap.
Oversize or unreadable media → clear error in logs and the reply is skipped.
Media understanding caps (transcription/description)
Image default: 10 MB (
tools.media.image.maxBytes
Audio default: 20 MB (
tools.media.audio.maxBytes
Video default: 50 MB (
tools.media.video.maxBytes
Oversize media skips understanding, but replies still go through with the original body.
Notes for Tests
Cover send + reply flows for image/audio/document cases.
Validate recompression for images (size bound) and voice-note flag for audio.
Ensure multi-media replies fan out as sequential sends.

Location command (nodes)
TL;DR
location.get
is a node command (via
node.invoke
Off by default.
Settings use a selector: Off / While Using / Always.
Separate toggle: Precise Location.
Why a selector (not just a switch)
OS permissions are multi-level. We can expose a selector in-app, but the OS still decides the actual grant.
iOS/macOS: user can choose
While Using
Always
in system prompts/Settings. App can request upgrade, but OS may require Settings.
Android: background location is a separate permission; on Android 10+ it often requires a Settings flow.
Precise location is a separate grant (iOS 14+ “Precise”, Android “fine” vs “coarse”).
Selector in UI drives our requested mode; actual grant lives in OS settings.
Settings model
Per node device:
location.enabledMode
off | whileUsing | always
location.preciseEnabled
: bool
UI behavior:
Selecting
whileUsing
requests foreground permission.
Selecting
always
first ensures
whileUsing
, then requests background (or sends user to Settings if required).
If OS denies requested level, revert to the highest granted level and show status.
Permissions mapping (node.permissions)
Optional. macOS node reports
location
via the permissions map; iOS/Android may omit it.
Command:
location.get
Called via
node.invoke

LOCATION_PERMISSION_REQUIRED
: permission missing for requested mode.
LOCATION_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE
: app is backgrounded but only While Using allowed.
LOCATION_TIMEOUT
: no fix in time.
LOCATION_UNAVAILABLE
: system failure / no providers.
Background behavior (future)
Goal: model can request location even when node is backgrounded, but only when:
User selected
Always
OS grants background location.
App is allowed to run in background for location (iOS background mode / Android foreground service or special allowance).
Push-triggered flow (future):
Gateway sends a push to the node (silent push or FCM data).
Node wakes briefly and requests location from the device.
Node forwards payload to Gateway.
Notes:
iOS: Always permission + background location mode required. Silent push may be throttled; expect intermittent failures.
Android: background location may require a foreground service; otherwise, expect denial.
Model/tooling integration
Tool surface:
nodes
tool adds
location_get
action (node required).
CLI:
openclaw nodes location get --node &lt;id&gt;
Agent guidelines: only call when user enabled location and understands the scope.
UX copy (suggested)
Off: “Location sharing is disabled.”
While Using: “Only when OpenClaw is open.”
Always: “Allow background location. Requires system permission.”
Precise: “Use precise GPS location. Toggle off to share approximate location.”

Talk Mode
Talk mode is a continuous voice conversation loop:
Listen for speech
Send transcript to the model (main session, chat.send)
Wait for the response
Speak it via ElevenLabs (streaming playback)
Behavior (macOS)
Always-on overlay
while Talk mode is enabled.
Listening → Thinking → Speaking
phase transitions.
On a
short pause
(silence window), the current transcript is sent.
Replies are
written to WebChat
(same as typing).
Interrupt on speech
(default on): if the user starts talking while the assistant is speaking, we stop playback and note the interruption timestamp for the next prompt.
Voice directives in replies
The assistant may prefix its reply with a
single JSON line
to control voice:
Copy
&quot;voice&quot;
&quot;&lt;voice-id&gt;&quot;
&quot;once&quot;
true
Rules:
First non-empty line only.
Unknown keys are ignored.
once: true
applies to the current reply only.
Without
once
, the voice becomes the new default for Talk mode.
The JSON line is stripped before TTS playback.

Use this page when a node is visible in status but node tools fail.
Command ladder
Copy

--probe
Then run node specific checks:
Copy
openclaw

status
openclaw
nodes
describe
--node
&lt;
idOrNameOrI
&gt;
openclaw
approvals
get
--node
&lt;

Healthy signals:
Node is connected and paired for role
node
nodes describe
includes the capability you are calling.
Exec approvals show expected mode/allowlist.
Foreground requirements
canvas.*
camera.*
, and
screen.*
are foreground only on iOS/Android nodes.
Quick check and fix:
Copy

If you see
NODE_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE
, bring the node app to the foreground and retry.

Pairing versus approvals
These are different gates:
Device pairing
: can this node connect to the gateway?
Exec approvals
: can this node run a specific shell command?
Quick checks:
Copy
openclaw
devices
list
openclaw
nodes
status

approvals
get
--node
&lt;
idOrNameOrI
&gt;
openclaw
approvals
allowlist
add
--node
&lt;
idOrNameOrI
&gt;
&quot;/usr/bin/uname&quot;
If pairing is missing, approve the node device first.
If pairing is fine but
system.run
fails, fix exec approvals/allowlist.
Common node error codes
NODE_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE
→ app is backgrounded; bring it foreground.
CAMERA_DISABLED
→ camera toggle disabled in node settings.
*_PERMISSION_REQUIRED
→ OS permission missing/denied.
LOCATION_DISABLED
→ location mode is off.
LOCATION_PERMISSION_REQUIRED
→ requested location mode not granted.
LOCATION_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE
→ app is backgrounded but only While Using permission exists.
SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED: approval required
→ exec request needs explicit approval.
SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED: allowlist miss
→ command blocked by allowlist mode.
Fast recovery loop

If still stuck:
Re-approve device pairing.
Re-open node app (foreground).
Re-grant OS permissions.
Recreate/adjust exec approval policy.

Voice Wake (Global Wake Words)
OpenClaw treats
wake words as a single global list
owned by the
Gateway
There are
no per-node custom wake words
Any node/app UI may edit
the list; changes are persisted by the Gateway and broadcast to everyone.
Each device still keeps its own
Voice Wake enabled/disabled
toggle (local UX + permissions differ).
Storage (Gateway host)
Wake words are stored on the gateway machine at:
~/.openclaw/settings/voicewake.json
Shape:
Copy
&quot;triggers&quot;
&quot;openclaw&quot;
&quot;claude&quot;
&quot;computer&quot;
&quot;updatedAtMs&quot;
1730000000000
Protocol
Methods
voicewake.get
{ triggers: string[] }
voicewake.set
with params
{ triggers: string[] }
{ triggers: string[] }
Notes:
Triggers are normalized (trimmed, empties dropped). Empty lists fall back to defaults.
Limits are enforced for safety (count/length caps).
Events
voicewake.changed
payload
{ triggers: string[] }
Who receives it:
All WebSocket clients (macOS app, WebChat, etc.)
All connected nodes (iOS/Android), and also on node connect as an initial “current state” push.
Client behavior
macOS app
Uses the global list to gate
VoiceWakeRuntime
triggers.
Editing “Trigger words” in Voice Wake settings calls
voicewake.set
and then relies on the broadcast to keep other clients in sync.
iOS node
Uses the global list for
VoiceWakeManager
trigger detection.
Editing Wake Words in Settings calls
voicewake.set
(over the Gateway WS) and also keeps local wake-word detection responsive.
Android node
Exposes a Wake Words editor in Settings.
Calls
voicewake.set
over the Gateway WS so edits sync everywhere.
