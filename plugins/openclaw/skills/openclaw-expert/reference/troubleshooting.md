Debugging
This page covers debugging helpers for streaming output, especially when a
provider mixes reasoning into normal text.
Runtime debug overrides
Use
/debug
in chat to set
runtime-only
config overrides (memory, not disk).
/debug
is disabled by default; enable with
commands.debug: true
This is handy when you need to toggle obscure settings without editing
openclaw.json
Examples:
Copy
/debug show
/debug set messages.responsePrefix=&quot;[openclaw]&quot;
/debug unset messages.responsePrefix
/debug reset
/debug reset
clears all overrides and returns to the on-disk config.
Gateway watch mode
For fast iteration, run the gateway under the file watcher:
Copy
pnpm
gateway:watch
--force
This maps to:
Copy
tsx
watch
src/entry.ts
gateway
--force
Add any gateway CLI flags after
gateway:watch
and they will be passed through
on each restart.
Dev profile + dev gateway (—dev)
Use the dev profile to isolate state and spin up a safe, disposable setup for
debugging. There are
two
--dev
flags:
Global
--dev
(profile):
isolates state under
~/.openclaw-dev
and
defaults the gateway port to
19001
(derived ports shift with it).
gateway --dev
: tells the Gateway to auto-create a default config +
workspace
when missing (and skip BOOTSTRAP.md).
Recommended flow (dev profile + dev bootstrap):
Copy
pnpm
gateway:dev
OPENCLAW_PROFILE
dev
openclaw
tui
If you don’t have a global install yet, run the CLI via
pnpm openclaw ...
What this does:
Profile isolation
(global
--dev
OPENCLAW_PROFILE=dev
OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=~/.openclaw-dev
OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH=~/.openclaw-dev/openclaw.json
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT=19001
(browser/canvas shift accordingly)
Dev bootstrap
gateway --dev
Writes a minimal config if missing (
gateway.mode=local
, bind loopback).
Sets
agent.workspace
to the dev workspace.
Sets
agent.skipBootstrap=true
(no BOOTSTRAP.md).
Seeds the workspace files if missing:
AGENTS.md
SOUL.md
TOOLS.md
IDENTITY.md
USER.md
HEARTBEAT.md
Default identity:
C3‑PO
(protocol droid).
Skips channel providers in dev mode (
OPENCLAW_SKIP_CHANNELS=1
Reset flow (fresh start):
Copy
pnpm
gateway:dev:reset
Note:
--dev
is a
global
profile flag and gets eaten by some runners.
If you need to spell it out, use the env var form:
Copy
OPENCLAW_PROFILE
dev
openclaw
gateway
--dev
--reset
--reset
wipes config, credentials, sessions, and the dev workspace (using
trash
, not
), then recreates the default dev setup.
Tip: if a non‑dev gateway is already running (launchd/systemd), stop it first:
Copy
openclaw
gateway
stop
Raw stream logging (OpenClaw)
OpenClaw can log the
raw assistant stream
before any filtering/formatting.
This is the best way to see whether reasoning is arriving as plain text deltas
(or as separate thinking blocks).
Enable it via CLI:
Copy
pnpm
gateway:watch
--force
--raw-stream
Optional path override:
Copy
pnpm
gateway:watch
--force
--raw-stream
--raw-stream-path
~/.openclaw/logs/raw-stream.jsonl
Equivalent env vars:
Copy
OPENCLAW_RAW_STREAM
OPENCLAW_RAW_STREAM_PATH
~/.openclaw/logs/raw-stream.jsonl
Default file:
~/.openclaw/logs/raw-stream.jsonl
Raw chunk logging (pi-mono)
To capture
raw OpenAI-compat chunks
before they are parsed into blocks,
pi-mono exposes a separate logger:
Copy
PI_RAW_STREAM
Optional path:
Copy
PI_RAW_STREAM_PATH
~/.pi-mono/logs/raw-openai-completions.jsonl
Default file:
~/.pi-mono/logs/raw-openai-completions.jsonl
Note: this is only emitted by processes using pi-mono’s
openai-completions
provider.
Safety notes
Raw stream logs can include full prompts, tool output, and user data.
Keep logs local and delete them after debugging.
If you share logs, scrub secrets and PII first.

Environment Variables
Environment variables
OpenClaw pulls environment variables from multiple sources. The rule is
never override existing values
Precedence (highest → lowest)
Process environment
(what the Gateway process already has from the parent shell/daemon).
.env
in the current working directory
(dotenv default; does not override).
Global
.env
~/.openclaw/.env
(aka
$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/.env
; does not override).
Config
env
block
~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
(applied only if missing).
Optional login-shell import
env.shellEnv.enabled
OPENCLAW_LOAD_SHELL_ENV=1
), applied only for missing expected keys.
If the config file is missing entirely, step 4 is skipped; shell import still runs if enabled.
Config
env
block
Two equivalent ways to set inline env vars (both are non-overriding):
Copy
env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY
&quot;sk-or-...&quot;
vars
GROQ_API_KEY
&quot;gsk-...&quot;
Shell env import
env.shellEnv
runs your login shell and imports only
missing
expected keys:
Copy
env
shellEnv
enabled
true
timeoutMs
15000
Env var equivalents:
OPENCLAW_LOAD_SHELL_ENV=1
OPENCLAW_SHELL_ENV_TIMEOUT_MS=15000
Env var substitution in config
You can reference env vars directly in config string values using
${VAR_NAME}
syntax:
Copy
models
providers
&quot;vercel-gateway&quot;
apiKey
&quot;${VERCEL_GATEWAY_API_KEY}&quot;
See
Configuration: Env var substitution
for full details.
Path-related env vars
Variable
Purpose
OPENCLAW_HOME
Override the home directory used for all internal path resolution (
~/.openclaw/
, agent dirs, sessions, credentials). Useful when running OpenClaw as a dedicated service user.
OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR
Override the state directory (default
~/.openclaw
OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH
Override the config file path (default
~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
OPENCLAW_HOME
When set,
OPENCLAW_HOME
replaces the system home directory (
$HOME
os.homedir()
) for all internal path resolution. This enables full filesystem isolation for headless service accounts.
Precedence:
OPENCLAW_HOME
&gt;
$HOME
&gt;
USERPROFILE
&gt;
os.homedir()
Example
(macOS LaunchDaemon):
Copy
&lt;
key
&gt;EnvironmentVariables&lt;/
key
&gt;
&lt;
dict
&gt;
&lt;
key
&gt;OPENCLAW_HOME&lt;/
key
&gt;
&lt;
string
&gt;/Users/kira&lt;/
string
&gt;
&lt;/
dict
&gt;
OPENCLAW_HOME
can also be set to a tilde path (e.g.
~/svc
), which gets expanded using
$HOME
before use.

Quick start and first-run setup
Im stuck whats the fastest way to get unstuck
Use a local AI agent that can
see your machine
. That is far more effective than asking
in Discord, because most “I’m stuck” cases are
local config or environment issues
that
remote helpers cannot inspect.
Claude Code
https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code/
OpenAI Codex
https://openai.com/codex/
These tools can read the repo, run commands, inspect logs, and help fix your machine-level
setup (PATH, services, permissions, auth files). Give them the
full source checkout
via
the hackable (git) install:
Copy
curl
-fsSL
https://openclaw.ai/install.sh
bash
--install-method
git
This installs OpenClaw
from a git checkout
, so the agent can read the code + docs and
reason about the exact version you are running. You can always switch back to stable later
by re-running the installer without
--install-method git
Tip: ask the agent to
plan and supervise
the fix (step-by-step), then execute only the
necessary commands. That keeps changes small and easier to audit.
If you discover a real bug or fix, please file a GitHub issue or send a PR:

What’s the recommended way to install and set up OpenClaw
The repo recommends running from source and using the onboarding wizard:
Copy
curl
-fsSL
https://openclaw.ai/install.sh
bash
openclaw
onboard
--install-daemon
The wizard can also build UI assets automatically. After onboarding, you typically run the Gateway on port
18789
From source (contributors/dev):
Copy
git
clone
https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
openclaw
pnpm
install
pnpm
build
pnpm
ui:build
# auto-installs UI deps on first run
openclaw
onboard
If you don’t have a global install yet, run it via
pnpm openclaw onboard
How do I open the dashboard after onboarding
The wizard opens your browser with a clean (non-tokenized) dashboard URL right after onboarding and also prints the link in the summary. Keep that tab open; if it didn’t launch, copy/paste the printed URL on the same machine.
How do I authenticate the dashboard token on localhost vs remote
Localhost (same machine):
Open
http://127.0.0.1:18789/
If it asks for auth, paste the token from
gateway.auth.token
(or
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN
) into Control UI settings.
Retrieve it from the gateway host:
openclaw config get gateway.auth.token
(or generate one:
openclaw doctor --generate-gateway-token
Not on localhost:
Tailscale Serve
(recommended): keep bind loopback, run
openclaw gateway --tailscale serve
, open
https://&lt;magicdns&gt;/
. If
gateway.auth.allowTailscale
true
, identity headers satisfy auth (no token).
Tailnet bind
: run
openclaw gateway --bind tailnet --token &quot;&lt;token&gt;&quot;
, open
http://&lt;tailscale-ip&gt;:18789/
, paste token in dashboard settings.
SSH tunnel
ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@host
then open
http://127.0.0.1:18789/
and paste the token in Control UI settings.
See
Dashboard
and
Web surfaces
for bind modes and auth details.
What runtime do I need
Node
&gt;= 22
is required.
pnpm
is recommended. Bun is
not recommended
for the Gateway.
Does it run on Raspberry Pi
Yes. The Gateway is lightweight - docs list
512MB-1GB RAM
1 core
, and about
500MB
disk as enough for personal use, and note that a
Raspberry Pi 4 can run it
If you want extra headroom (logs, media, other services),
2GB is recommended
, but it’s
not a hard minimum.
Tip: a small Pi/VPS can host the Gateway, and you can pair
nodes
on your laptop/phone for
local screen/camera/canvas or command execution. See
Nodes
Any tips for Raspberry Pi installs
Short version: it works, but expect rough edges.
Use a
64-bit
OS and keep Node &gt;= 22.
Prefer the
hackable (git) install
so you can see logs and update fast.
Start without channels/skills, then add them one by one.
If you hit weird binary issues, it is usually an
ARM compatibility
problem.
Docs:
Linux
Install
It is stuck on wake up my friend onboarding will not hatch What now
That screen depends on the Gateway being reachable and authenticated. The TUI also sends
“Wake up, my friend!” automatically on first hatch. If you see that line with
no reply
and tokens stay at 0, the agent never ran.
Restart the Gateway:
Copy
openclaw
gateway
restart
Check status + auth:
Copy
openclaw
status
openclaw
models
status
openclaw
logs
--follow
If it still hangs, run:
Copy
openclaw
doctor
If the Gateway is remote, ensure the tunnel/Tailscale connection is up and that the UI
is pointed at the right Gateway. See
Remote access
Can I migrate my setup to a new machine Mac mini without redoing onboarding
Yes. Copy the
state directory
and
workspace
, then run Doctor once. This
keeps your bot “exactly the same” (memory, session history, auth, and channel
state) as long as you copy
both
locations:
Install OpenClaw on the new machine.
Copy
$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR
(default:
~/.openclaw
) from the old machine.
Copy your workspace (default:
~/.openclaw/workspace
Run
openclaw doctor
and restart the Gateway service.
That preserves config, auth profiles, WhatsApp creds, sessions, and memory. If you’re in
remote mode, remember the gateway host owns the session store and workspace.
Important:
if you only commit/push your workspace to GitHub, you’re backing
memory + bootstrap files
, but
not
session history or auth. Those live
under
~/.openclaw/
(for example
~/.openclaw/agents/&lt;agentId&gt;/sessions/

What’s the difference between stable and beta
Stable
and
beta
are
npm dist-tags
, not separate code lines:
latest
= stable
beta
= early build for testing
We ship builds to
beta
, test them, and once a build is solid we
promote
that same version to
latest
. That’s why beta and stable can point at the
same version
See what changed:

How do I install the beta version and whats the difference between beta and dev
Beta

How do I install OpenClaw on a VPS
Any Linux VPS works. Install on the server, then use SSH/Tailscale to reach the Gateway.
Guides:

Where are the cloudVPS install guides
We keep a
hosting hub
with the common providers. Pick one and follow the guide:
VPS hosting
(all providers in one place)
Fly.io
Hetzner
exe.dev
How it works in the cloud: the
Gateway runs on the server
, and you access it
from your laptop/phone via the Control UI (or Tailscale/SSH). Your state + workspace
live on the server, so treat the host as the source of truth and back it up.
You can pair
nodes
(Mac/iOS/Android/headless) to that cloud Gateway to access
local screen/camera/canvas or run commands on your laptop while keeping the
Gateway in the cloud.

Can I ask OpenClaw to update itself
Short answer:
possible, not recommended
. The update flow can restart the
Gateway (which drops the active session), may need a clean git checkout, and
can prompt for confirmation. Safer: run updates from a shell as the operator.
Use the CLI:

What does the onboarding wizard actually do
openclaw onboard
is the recommended setup path. In
local mode
it walks you through:
Model/auth setup
(Anthropic
setup-token
recommended for Claude subscriptions, OpenAI Codex OAuth supported, API keys optional, LM Studio local models supported)
Workspace
location + bootstrap files
Gateway settings
(bind/port/auth/tailscale)
Providers
(WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Mattermost (plugin), Signal, iMessage)
Daemon install
(LaunchAgent on macOS; systemd user unit on Linux/WSL2)
Health checks
and
skills
selection
It also warns if your configured model is unknown or missing auth.
Do I need a Claude or OpenAI subscription to run this
No. You can run OpenClaw with
API keys
(Anthropic/OpenAI/others) or with
local-only models
so your data stays on your device. Subscriptions (Claude
Pro/Max or OpenAI Codex) are optional ways to authenticate those providers.
Docs:
Anthropic
OpenAI
Local models
Models
Can I use Claude Max subscription without an API key
Yes. You can authenticate with a
setup-token
instead of an API key. This is the subscription path.
Claude Pro/Max subscriptions
do not include an API key
, so this is the
correct approach for subscription accounts. Important: you must verify with
Anthropic that this usage is allowed under their subscription policy and terms.
If you want the most explicit, supported path, use an Anthropic API key.
How does Anthropic setuptoken auth work
claude setup-token
generates a
token string
via the Claude Code CLI (it is not available in the web console). You can run it on
any machine
. Choose
Anthropic token (paste setup-token)
in the wizard or paste it with
openclaw models auth paste-token --provider anthropic
. The token is stored as an auth profile for the
anthropic
provider and used like an API key (no auto-refresh). More detail:
OAuth
Where do I find an Anthropic setuptoken
It is
not
in the Anthropic Console. The setup-token is generated by the
Claude Code CLI
any machine
Copy
claude
setup-token
Copy the token it prints, then choose
Anthropic token (paste setup-token)
in the wizard. If you want to run it on the gateway host, use
openclaw models auth setup-token --provider anthropic
. If you ran
claude setup-token
elsewhere, paste it on the gateway host with
openclaw models auth paste-token --provider anthropic
. See
Anthropic
Do you support Claude subscription auth (Claude Pro or Max)
Yes - via
setup-token
. OpenClaw no longer reuses Claude Code CLI OAuth tokens; use a setup-token or an Anthropic API key. Generate the token anywhere and paste it on the gateway host. See
Anthropic
and
OAuth
Note: Claude subscription access is governed by Anthropic’s terms. For production or multi-user workloads, API keys are usually the safer choice.
Why am I seeing HTTP 429 ratelimiterror from Anthropic
That means your
Anthropic quota/rate limit
is exhausted for the current window. If you
use a
Claude subscription
(setup-token or Claude Code OAuth), wait for the window to
reset or upgrade your plan. If you use an
Anthropic API key
, check the Anthropic Console
for usage/billing and raise limits as needed.
Tip: set a
fallback model
so OpenClaw can keep replying while a provider is rate-limited.
See
Models
and
OAuth
Is AWS Bedrock supported
Yes - via pi-ai’s
Amazon Bedrock (Converse)
provider with
manual config
. You must supply AWS credentials/region on the gateway host and add a Bedrock provider entry in your models config. See
Amazon Bedrock
and
Model providers
. If you prefer a managed key flow, an OpenAI-compatible proxy in front of Bedrock is still a valid option.
How does Codex auth work
OpenClaw supports
OpenAI Code (Codex)
via OAuth (ChatGPT sign-in). The wizard can run the OAuth flow and will set the default model to
openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex
when appropriate. See
Model providers
and
Wizard
Do you support OpenAI subscription auth Codex OAuth
Yes. OpenClaw fully supports
OpenAI Code (Codex) subscription OAuth
. The onboarding wizard
can run the OAuth flow for you.
See
OAuth
Model providers
, and
Wizard
How do I set up Gemini CLI OAuth
Gemini CLI uses a
plugin auth flow
, not a client id or secret in
openclaw.json
Steps:
Enable the plugin:
openclaw plugins enable google-gemini-cli-auth
Login:
openclaw models auth login --provider google-gemini-cli --set-default
This stores OAuth tokens in auth profiles on the gateway host. Details:
Model providers
Is a local model OK for casual chats
Usually no. OpenClaw needs large context + strong safety; small cards truncate and leak. If you must, run the
largest
MiniMax M2.1 build you can locally (LM Studio) and see
/gateway/local-models
. Smaller/quantized models increase prompt-injection risk - see
Security
How do I keep hosted model traffic in a specific region
Pick region-pinned endpoints. OpenRouter exposes US-hosted options for MiniMax, Kimi, and GLM; choose the US-hosted variant to keep data in-region. You can still list Anthropic/OpenAI alongside these by using
models.mode: &quot;merge&quot;
so fallbacks stay available while respecting the regioned provider you select.
Do I have to buy a Mac Mini to install this
No. OpenClaw runs on macOS or Linux (Windows via WSL2). A Mac mini is optional - some people
buy one as an always-on host, but a small VPS, home server, or Raspberry Pi-class box works too.
You only need a Mac
for macOS-only tools
. For iMessage, use
BlueBubbles
(recommended) - the BlueBubbles server runs on any Mac, and the Gateway can run on Linux or elsewhere. If you want other macOS-only tools, run the Gateway on a Mac or pair a macOS node.
Docs:
BlueBubbles
Nodes
Mac remote mode
Do I need a Mac mini for iMessage support
You need
some macOS device
signed into Messages. It does
not
have to be a Mac mini -
any Mac works.
Use
BlueBubbles
(recommended) for iMessage - the BlueBubbles server runs on macOS, while the Gateway can run on Linux or elsewhere.
Common setups:
Run the Gateway on Linux/VPS, and run the BlueBubbles server on any Mac signed into Messages.
Run everything on the Mac if you want the simplest single‑machine setup.
Docs:
BlueBubbles
Nodes
Mac remote mode
If I buy a Mac mini to run OpenClaw can I connect it to my MacBook Pro
Yes. The
Mac mini can run the Gateway
, and your MacBook Pro can connect as a
node
(companion device). Nodes don’t run the Gateway - they provide extra
capabilities like screen/camera/canvas and
system.run
on that device.
Common pattern:
Gateway on the Mac mini (always-on).
MacBook Pro runs the macOS app or a node host and pairs to the Gateway.
Use
openclaw nodes status
openclaw nodes list
to see it.
Docs:
Nodes
Nodes CLI
Can I use Bun
Bun is
not recommended
. We see runtime bugs, especially with WhatsApp and Telegram.
Use
Node
for stable gateways.
If you still want to experiment with Bun, do it on a non-production gateway
without WhatsApp/Telegram.
Telegram what goes in allowFrom
channels.telegram.allowFrom
the human sender’s Telegram user ID
(numeric). It is not the bot username.
The onboarding wizard accepts
@username
input and resolves it to a numeric ID, but OpenClaw authorization uses numeric IDs only.
Safer (no third-party bot):
DM your bot, then run
openclaw logs --follow
and read
from.id
Official Bot API:
DM your bot, then call
https://api.telegram.org/bot&lt;bot_token&gt;/getUpdates
and read
message.from.id
Third-party (less private):
@userinfobot
@getidsbot
See
/channels/telegram
Can multiple people use one WhatsApp number with different OpenClaw instances
Yes, via
multi-agent routing
. Bind each sender’s WhatsApp
(peer
kind: &quot;direct&quot;
, sender E.164 like
+15551234567
) to a different
agentId
, so each person gets their own workspace and session store. Replies still come from the
same WhatsApp account
, and DM access control (
channels.whatsapp.dmPolicy
channels.whatsapp.allowFrom
) is global per WhatsApp account. See
Multi-Agent Routing
and
WhatsApp
Can I run a fast chat agent and an Opus for coding agent
Yes. Use multi-agent routing: give each agent its own default model, then bind inbound routes (provider account or specific peers) to each agent. Example config lives in
Multi-Agent Routing
. See also
Models
and
Configuration
Does Homebrew work on Linux
Yes. Homebrew supports Linux (Linuxbrew). Quick setup:
Copy
/bin/bash
&quot;$(
curl
-fsSL
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh
)&quot;
echo
&#x27;eval &quot;$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)&quot;&#x27;
&gt;&gt;
~/.profile
eval
&quot;$(
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew
shellenv
)&quot;
brew
install
&lt;
formul
&gt;
If you run OpenClaw via systemd, ensure the service PATH includes
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin
(or your brew prefix) so
brew
-installed tools resolve in non-login shells.
Recent builds also prepend common user bin dirs on Linux systemd services (for example
~/.local/bin
~/.npm-global/bin
~/.local/share/pnpm
~/.bun/bin
) and honor
PNPM_HOME
NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX
BUN_INSTALL
VOLTA_HOME
ASDF_DATA_DIR
NVM_DIR
, and
FNM_DIR
when set.
What’s the difference between the hackable git install and npm install
Hackable (git) install:
full source checkout, editable, best for contributors.
You run builds locally and can patch code/docs.
npm install:
global CLI install, no repo, best for “just run it.”
Updates come from npm dist-tags.
Docs:
Getting started
Updating
Can I switch between npm and git installs later
Yes. Install the other flavor, then run Doctor so the gateway service points at the new entrypoint.
This
does not delete your data
- it only changes the OpenClaw code install. Your state
~/.openclaw
) and workspace (
~/.openclaw/workspace
) stay untouched.
From npm → git:
Copy
git
clone
https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
openclaw
pnpm
install
pnpm
build
openclaw
doctor
openclaw
gateway
restart
From git → npm:
Copy
npm
install
openclaw@latest
openclaw
doctor
openclaw
gateway
restart
Doctor detects a gateway service entrypoint mismatch and offers to rewrite the service config to match the current install (use
--repair
in automation).
Backup tips: see
Backup strategy
Should I run the Gateway on my laptop or a VPS
Short answer:
if you want 24/7 reliability, use a VPS
. If you want the
lowest friction and you’re okay with sleep/restarts, run it locally.
Laptop (local Gateway)
Pros:
no server cost, direct access to local files, live browser window.
Cons:
sleep/network drops = disconnects, OS updates/reboots interrupt, must stay awake.
VPS / cloud
Pros:
always-on, stable network, no laptop sleep issues, easier to keep running.
Cons:
often run headless (use screenshots), remote file access only, you must SSH for updates.
OpenClaw-specific note:
WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/Mattermost (plugin)/Discord all work fine from a VPS. The only real trade-off is
headless browser
vs a visible window. See
Browser
Recommended default:
VPS if you had gateway disconnects before. Local is great when you’re actively using the Mac and want local file access or UI automation with a visible browser.
How important is it to run OpenClaw on a dedicated machine
Not required, but
recommended for reliability and isolation
Dedicated host (VPS/Mac mini/Pi):
always-on, fewer sleep/reboot interruptions, cleaner permissions, easier to keep running.
Shared laptop/desktop:
totally fine for testing and active use, but expect pauses when the machine sleeps or updates.
If you want the best of both worlds, keep the Gateway on a dedicated host and pair your laptop as a
node
for local screen/camera/exec tools. See
Nodes
For security guidance, read
Security
What are the minimum VPS requirements and recommended OS
OpenClaw is lightweight. For a basic Gateway + one chat channel:
Absolute minimum:
1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, ~500MB disk.
Recommended:
1-2 vCPU, 2GB RAM or more for headroom (logs, media, multiple channels). Node tools and browser automation can be resource hungry.
OS: use
Ubuntu LTS
(or any modern Debian/Ubuntu). The Linux install path is best tested there.
Docs:
Linux
VPS hosting
Can I run OpenClaw in a VM and what are the requirements
Yes. Treat a VM the same as a VPS: it needs to be always on, reachable, and have enough
RAM for the Gateway and any channels you enable.
Baseline guidance:
Absolute minimum:
1 vCPU, 1GB RAM.
Recommended:
2GB RAM or more if you run multiple channels, browser automation, or media tools.
OS:
Ubuntu LTS or another modern Debian/Ubuntu.
If you are on Windows,
WSL2 is the easiest VM style setup
and has the best tooling
compatibility. See

What is OpenClaw?
What is OpenClaw in one paragraph
OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant you run on your own devices. It replies on the messaging surfaces you already use (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Mattermost (plugin), Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, WebChat) and can also do voice + a live Canvas on supported platforms. The
Gateway
is the always-on control plane; the assistant is the product.
What’s the value proposition
OpenClaw is not “just a Claude wrapper.” It’s a
local-first control plane
that lets you run a
capable assistant on
your own hardware
, reachable from the chat apps you already use, with
stateful sessions, memory, and tools - without handing control of your workflows to a hosted
SaaS.
Highlights:
Your devices, your data:
run the Gateway wherever you want (Mac, Linux, VPS) and keep the
workspace + session history local.
Real channels, not a web sandbox:
WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/Discord/Signal/iMessage/etc,
plus mobile voice and Canvas on supported platforms.
Model-agnostic:
use Anthropic, OpenAI, MiniMax, OpenRouter, etc., with per-agent routing
and failover.
Local-only option:
run local models so
all data can stay on your device
if you want.
Multi-agent routing:
separate agents per channel, account, or task, each with its own
workspace and defaults.
Open source and hackable:
inspect, extend, and self-host without vendor lock-in.
Docs:
Gateway
Channels

I just set it up what should I do first
Good first projects:
Build a website (WordPress, Shopify, or a simple static site).
Prototype a mobile app (outline, screens, API plan).
Organize files and folders (cleanup, naming, tagging).
Connect Gmail and automate summaries or follow ups.
It can handle large tasks, but it works best when you split them into phases and
use sub agents for parallel work.
What are the top five everyday use cases for OpenClaw
Everyday wins usually look like:
Personal briefings:
summaries of inbox, calendar, and news you care about.
Research and drafting:
quick research, summaries, and first drafts for emails or docs.
Reminders and follow ups:
cron or heartbeat driven nudges and checklists.
Browser automation:
filling forms, collecting data, and repeating web tasks.
Cross device coordination:
send a task from your phone, let the Gateway run it on a server, and get the result back in chat.
Can OpenClaw help with lead gen outreach ads and blogs for a SaaS
Yes for
research, qualification, and drafting
. It can scan sites, build shortlists,
summarize prospects, and write outreach or ad copy drafts.
For
outreach or ad runs
, keep a human in the loop. Avoid spam, follow local laws and
platform policies, and review anything before it is sent. The safest pattern is to let
OpenClaw draft and you approve.

Security
What are the advantages vs Claude Code for web development
OpenClaw is a
personal assistant
and coordination layer, not an IDE replacement. Use
Claude Code or Codex for the fastest direct coding loop inside a repo. Use OpenClaw when you
want durable memory, cross-device access, and tool orchestration.
Advantages:
Persistent memory + workspace
across sessions
Multi-platform access
(WhatsApp, Telegram, TUI, WebChat)

Skills and automation
How do I customize skills without keeping the repo dirty
Use managed overrides instead of editing the repo copy. Put your changes in
~/.openclaw/skills/&lt;name&gt;/SKILL.md
(or add a folder via
skills.load.extraDirs
~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
). Precedence is
&lt;workspace&gt;/skills
&gt;
~/.openclaw/skills
&gt; bundled, so managed overrides win without touching git. Only upstream-worthy edits should live in the repo and go out as PRs.
Can I load skills from a custom folder
Yes. Add extra directories via
skills.load.extraDirs
~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
(lowest precedence). Default precedence remains:
&lt;workspace&gt;/skills
~/.openclaw/skills
→ bundled →
skills.load.extraDirs
clawhub
installs into
./skills
by default, which OpenClaw treats as
&lt;workspace&gt;/skills
How can I use different models for different tasks
Today the supported patterns are:
Cron jobs
: isolated jobs can set a
model
override per job.
Sub-agents
: route tasks to separate agents with different default models.
On-demand switch
: use
/model
to switch the current session model at any time.
See
Cron jobs
Multi-Agent Routing
, and
Slash commands
The bot freezes while doing heavy work How do I offload that
Use
sub-agents
for long or parallel tasks. Sub-agents run in their own session,
return a summary, and keep your main chat responsive.
Ask your bot to “spawn a sub-agent for this task” or use
/subagents
Use
/status
in chat to see what the Gateway is doing right now (and whether it is busy).
Token tip: long tasks and sub-agents both consume tokens. If cost is a concern, set a
cheaper model for sub-agents via
agents.defaults.subagents.model
Docs:
Sub-agents
Cron or reminders do not fire What should I check
Cron runs inside the Gateway process. If the Gateway is not running continuously,
scheduled jobs will not run.
Checklist:
Confirm cron is enabled (
cron.enabled
) and
OPENCLAW_SKIP_CRON
is not set.
Check the Gateway is running 24/7 (no sleep/restarts).
Verify timezone settings for the job (
--tz
vs host timezone).

How do I install skills on Linux
Use
ClawHub
(CLI) or drop skills into your workspace. The macOS Skills UI isn’t available on Linux.
Browse skills at
https://clawhub.com
Install the ClawHub CLI (pick one package manager):
Copy
npm
clawhub
Copy
pnpm
add
clawhub
Can OpenClaw run tasks on a schedule or continuously in the background
Yes. Use the Gateway scheduler:
Cron jobs
for scheduled or recurring tasks (persist across restarts).
Heartbeat
for “main session” periodic checks.
Isolated jobs
for autonomous agents that post summaries or deliver to chats.

Can I run Apple macOS-only skills from Linux?
Not directly. macOS skills are gated by
metadata.openclaw.os
plus required binaries, and skills only appear in the system prompt when they are eligible on the
Gateway host
. On Linux,
darwin
-only skills (like
apple-notes
apple-reminders
things-mac
) will not load unless you override the gating.
You have three supported patterns:
Option A - run the Gateway on a Mac (simplest).
Run the Gateway where the macOS binaries exist, then connect from Linux in
remote mode
or over Tailscale. The skills load normally because the Gateway host is macOS.
Option B - use a macOS node (no SSH).
Run the Gateway on Linux, pair a macOS node (menubar app), and set
Node Run Commands
to “Always Ask” or “Always Allow” on the Mac. OpenClaw can treat macOS-only skills as eligible when the required binaries exist on the node. The agent runs those skills via the
nodes
tool. If you choose “Always Ask”, approving “Always Allow” in the prompt adds that command to the allowlist.
Option C - proxy macOS binaries over SSH (advanced).
Keep the Gateway on Linux, but make the required CLI binaries resolve to SSH wrappers that run on a Mac. Then override the skill to allow Linux so it stays eligible.
Create an SSH wrapper for the binary (example:
memo
for Apple Notes):
Copy
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set
-euo
pipefail
exec
ssh
user@mac-host
/opt/homebrew/bin/memo
&quot;$@&quot;
Put the wrapper on
PATH
on the Linux host (for example
~/bin/memo
Override the skill metadata (workspace or
~/.openclaw/skills
) to allow Linux:
Copy
---
name
apple-notes
description
Manage Apple Notes via the memo CLI on macOS.

&quot;bins&quot;
&quot;memo&quot;
] } } }
---
Start a new session so the skills snapshot refreshes.
Do you have a Notion or HeyGen integration
Not built-in today.
Options:
Custom skill / plugin:
best for reliable API access (Notion/HeyGen both have APIs).
Browser automation:
works without code but is slower and more fragile.
If you want to keep context per client (agency workflows), a simple pattern is:
One Notion page per client (context + preferences + active work).
Ask the agent to fetch that page at the start of a session.
If you want a native integration, open a feature request or build a skill
targeting those APIs.
Install skills:
Copy
clawhub
install
&lt;
skill-slu
&gt;
clawhub
update
--all
ClawHub installs into
./skills
under your current directory (or falls back to your configured OpenClaw workspace); OpenClaw treats that as
&lt;workspace&gt;/skills
on the next session. For shared skills across agents, place them in
~/.openclaw/skills/&lt;name&gt;/SKILL.md
. Some skills expect binaries installed via Homebrew; on Linux that means Linuxbrew (see the Homebrew Linux FAQ entry above). See
Skills
and
ClawHub
How do I install the Chrome extension for browser takeover
Use the built-in installer, then load the unpacked extension in Chrome:
Copy
openclaw
browser
extension
install
openclaw
browser
extension
path
Then Chrome →
chrome://extensions
→ enable “Developer mode” → “Load unpacked” → pick that folder.
Full guide (including remote Gateway + security notes):
Chrome extension
If the Gateway runs on the same machine as Chrome (default setup), you usually
do not
need anything extra.
If the Gateway runs elsewhere, run a node host on the browser machine so the Gateway can proxy browser actions.
You still need to click the extension button on the tab you want to control (it doesn’t auto-attach).
Sandboxing and memory
Is there a dedicated sandboxing doc
Yes. See
Sandboxing
. For Docker-specific setup (full gateway in Docker or sandbox images), see
Docker
Docker feels limited How do I enable full features
The default image is security-first and runs as the
node
user, so it does not
include system packages, Homebrew, or bundled browsers. For a fuller setup:
Persist
/home/node
with
OPENCLAW_HOME_VOLUME
so caches survive.
Bake system deps into the image with
OPENCLAW_DOCKER_APT_PACKAGES
Install Playwright browsers via the bundled CLI:
node /app/node_modules/playwright-core/cli.js install chromium
Set
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH
and ensure the path is persisted.

Can I keep DMs personal but make groups public sandboxed with one agent
Yes - if your private traffic is
DMs
and your public traffic is
groups
Use
agents.defaults.sandbox.mode: &quot;non-main&quot;
so group/channel sessions (non-main keys) run in Docker, while the main DM session stays on-host. Then restrict what tools are available in sandboxed sessions via
tools.sandbox.tools
Setup walkthrough + example config:
Groups: personal DMs + public groups
Key config reference:
Gateway configuration
How do I bind a host folder into the sandbox
Set
agents.defaults.sandbox.docker.binds
[&quot;host:path:mode&quot;]
(e.g.,
&quot;/home/user/src:/src:ro&quot;
). Global + per-agent binds merge; per-agent binds are ignored when
scope: &quot;shared&quot;
. Use
:ro
for anything sensitive and remember binds bypass the sandbox filesystem walls. See
Sandboxing
and
Sandbox vs Tool Policy vs Elevated
for examples and safety notes.
How does memory work
OpenClaw memory is just Markdown files in the agent workspace:
Daily notes in
memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
Curated long-term notes in
MEMORY.md
(main/private sessions only)
OpenClaw also runs a
silent pre-compaction memory flush
to remind the model
to write durable notes before auto-compaction. This only runs when the workspace
is writable (read-only sandboxes skip it). See
Memory
Memory keeps forgetting things How do I make it stick
Ask the bot to
write the fact to memory
. Long-term notes belong in
MEMORY.md
short-term context goes into
memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
This is still an area we are improving. It helps to remind the model to store memories;
it will know what to do. If it keeps forgetting, verify the Gateway is using the same
workspace on every run.

Does semantic memory search require an OpenAI API key
Only if you use
OpenAI embeddings
. Codex OAuth covers chat/completions and
does
not
grant embeddings access, so
signing in with Codex (OAuth or the
Codex CLI login)
does not help for semantic memory search. OpenAI embeddings
still need a real API key (
OPENAI_API_KEY
models.providers.openai.apiKey
If you don’t set a provider explicitly, OpenClaw auto-selects a provider when it
can resolve an API key (auth profiles,
models.providers.*.apiKey
, or env vars).
It prefers OpenAI if an OpenAI key resolves, otherwise Gemini if a Gemini key
resolves. If neither key is available, memory search stays disabled until you
configure it. If you have a local model path configured and present, OpenClaw
prefers
local
If you’d rather stay local, set
memorySearch.provider = &quot;local&quot;
(and optionally
memorySearch.fallback = &quot;none&quot;
). If you want Gemini embeddings, set
memorySearch.provider = &quot;gemini&quot;
and provide
GEMINI_API_KEY
(or
memorySearch.remote.apiKey
). We support
OpenAI, Gemini, or local
embedding
models - see
Memory
for the setup details.
Does memory persist forever What are the limits
Memory files live on disk and persist until you delete them. The limit is your
storage, not the model. The
session context
is still limited by the model
context window, so long conversations can compact or truncate. That is why
memory search exists - it pulls only the relevant parts back into context.
Docs:
Memory
Context
Where things live on disk
Is all data used with OpenClaw saved locally
No -
OpenClaw’s state is local
, but
external services still see what you send them
Local by default:
sessions, memory files, config, and workspace live on the Gateway host
~/.openclaw
+ your workspace directory).
Remote by necessity:
messages you send to model providers (Anthropic/OpenAI/etc.) go to
their APIs, and chat platforms (WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/etc.) store message data on their
servers.
You control the footprint:
using local models keeps prompts on your machine, but channel
traffic still goes through the channel’s servers.

If you need a full restore, back up both the workspace and the state directory

How do I completely uninstall OpenClaw
See the dedicated guide:
Uninstall
Can agents work outside the workspace
Yes. The workspace is the
default cwd
and memory anchor, not a hard sandbox.
Relative paths resolve inside the workspace, but absolute paths can access other
host locations unless sandboxing is enabled. If you need isolation, use
agents.defaults.sandbox
or per-agent sandbox settings. If you
want a repo to be the default working directory, point that agent’s
workspace
to the repo root. The OpenClaw repo is just source code; keep the
workspace separate unless you intentionally want the agent to work inside it.
Example (repo as default cwd):
Copy

Why do I need a token on localhost now
The wizard generates a gateway token by default (even on loopback) so
local WS clients must authenticate
. This blocks other local processes from calling the Gateway. Paste the token into the Control UI settings (or your client config) to connect.
If you

How do I run a central Gateway with specialized workers across devices
The common pattern is
one Gateway
(e.g. Raspberry Pi) plus
nodes

Nodes (devices):
Macs/iOS/Android connect as peripherals and expose local tools (
system.run
canvas
camera
Agents (workers):
separate brains/workspaces for special roles (e.g. “Hetzner ops”, “Personal data”).
Sub-agents:
spawn background work from a main agent when you want parallelism.
TUI:
connect to the Gateway and switch agents/sessions.

Can the OpenClaw browser run headless
Yes. It’s a config option:
Copy
browser
headless
true
agents
defaults
sandbox
browser
headless
true
} }
Default is
false
(headful). Headless is more likely to trigger anti-bot checks on some sites. See
Browser
Headless uses the
same Chromium engine
and works for most automation (forms, clicks, scraping, logins). The main differences:
No visible browser window (use screenshots if you need visuals).
Some sites are stricter about automation in headless mode (CAPTCHAs, anti-bot).
For example, X/Twitter often blocks headless sessions.
How do I use Brave for browser control
Set
browser.executablePath
to your Brave binary (or any Chromium-based browser) and restart the Gateway.

Browser
Remote gateways and nodes
How do commands propagate between Telegram the gateway and nodes
Telegram messages are handled by the
gateway
. The gateway runs the agent and
only then calls nodes over the
Gateway WebSocket
when a node tool is needed:
Telegram → Gateway → Agent →
node.*
→ Node → Gateway → Telegram
Nodes don’t see inbound provider traffic; they only receive node RPC calls.
How can my agent access my computer if the Gateway is hosted remotely
Short answer:
pair your computer as a node
. The Gateway runs elsewhere, but it can
call
node.*
tools (screen, camera, system) on your local machine over the Gateway WebSocket.
Typical setup:
Run the Gateway on the always-on host (VPS/home server).
Put the Gateway host + your computer on the same tailnet.
Ensure the Gateway WS is reachable (tailnet bind or SSH tunnel).
Open the macOS app locally and connect in
Remote over SSH
mode (or direct tailnet)
so it can register as a node.
Approve the node on the Gateway:
Copy
openclaw
nodes
pending
openclaw
nodes
approve
&lt;
requestI
&gt;
No separate TCP bridge is required; nodes connect over the Gateway WebSocket.

on that machine. Only
pair devices you trust, and review

Remote access
Channels
Can two OpenClaw instances talk to each other local VPS
Yes. There is no built-in “bot-to-bot” bridge, but you can wire it up in a few
reliable ways:
Simplest:
use a normal chat channel both bots can access (Telegram/Slack/WhatsApp).
Have Bot A send a message to Bot B, then let Bot B reply as usual.
CLI bridge (generic):
run a script that calls the other Gateway with
openclaw agent --message ... --deliver
, targeting a chat where the other bot
listens. If one bot is on a remote VPS, point your CLI at that remote Gateway
via SSH/Tailscale (see
Remote access
Example pattern (run from a machine that can reach the target Gateway):
Copy
openclaw
agent
--message
&quot;Hello from local bot&quot;
--deliver
--channel
telegram
--reply-to
&lt;
chat-i
&gt;
Tip: add a guardrail so the two bots do not loop endlessly (mention-only, channel
allowlists, or a “do not reply to bot messages” rule).
Docs:

Agent CLI

Do I need separate VPSes for multiple agents
No. One Gateway can host multiple agents, each with its own workspace, model defaults,
and routing. That is the normal setup and it is much cheaper and simpler than running
one VPS per agent.
Use separate VPSes only when you need hard isolation (security boundaries) or very
different configs that you do not want to share. Otherwise, keep one Gateway and
use multiple agents or sub-agents.
Is there a benefit to using a node on my personal laptop instead of SSH from a VPS
Yes - nodes are the first-class way to reach your laptop from a remote Gateway, and they
unlock more than shell access. The Gateway runs on macOS/Linux (Windows via WSL2) and is
lightweight (a small VPS or Raspberry Pi-class box is fine; 4 GB RAM is plenty), so a common
setup is an always-on host plus your laptop as a node.
No inbound SSH required.
Nodes connect out to the Gateway WebSocket and use device pairing.
Safer execution controls.
system.run
is gated by node allowlists/approvals on that laptop.
More device tools.
Nodes expose
canvas
camera
, and
screen
in addition to
system.run
Local browser automation.
Keep the Gateway on a VPS, but run Chrome locally and relay control
with the Chrome extension + a node host on the laptop.
SSH is fine for ad-hoc shell access, but nodes are simpler for ongoing agent workflows and
device automation.

Should I install on a second laptop or just add a node
If you only need
local tools
(screen/camera/exec) on the second laptop, add it as a
node
. That keeps a single Gateway and avoids duplicated config. Local node tools are
currently macOS-only, but we plan to extend them to other OSes.
Install a second Gateway only when you need
hard isolation
or two fully separate bots.
Docs:
Nodes
Nodes CLI
Multiple gateways
Do nodes run a gateway service
No. Only
one gateway
should run per host unless you intentionally run isolated profiles (see
Multiple gateways
). Nodes are peripherals that connect
to the gateway (iOS/Android nodes, or macOS “node mode” in the menubar app). For headless node
hosts and CLI control, see
Node host CLI
A full restart is required for
gateway

, and
canvasHost
changes.
Is there an API RPC way to apply config
Yes.
config.apply
validates + writes the full config and restarts the Gateway as part of the operation.
configapply wiped my config How do I recover and avoid this
config.apply
replaces the
entire config
. If you send a partial object, everything
else is removed.
Recover:
Restore from backup (git or a copied
~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
If you have no backup, re-run
openclaw doctor
and reconfigure channels/models.
If this was unexpected, file a bug and include your last known config or any backup.
A local coding agent can often reconstruct a working config from logs or history.

Use

Env vars and .env loading
How does OpenClaw load environment variables
OpenClaw reads env vars from the parent process (shell, launchd/systemd, CI, etc.) and additionally loads:
.env
from the current working directory
a global fallback
.env
from
~/.openclaw/.env
(aka
$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/.env
Neither
.env
file overrides existing env vars.
You can also define inline env vars in config (applied only if missing from the process env):
Copy
env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY
&quot;sk-or-...&quot;
vars
GROQ_API_KEY
&quot;gsk-...&quot;
See
/environment
for full precedence and sources.
I started the Gateway via the service and my env vars disappeared What now
Two common fixes:
Put the missing keys in
~/.openclaw/.env
so they’re picked up even when the service doesn’t inherit your shell env.
Enable shell import (opt-in convenience):
Copy
env
shellEnv
enabled
true
timeoutMs
15000
This runs your login shell and imports only missing expected keys (never overrides). Env var equivalents:
OPENCLAW_LOAD_SHELL_ENV=1
OPENCLAW_SHELL_ENV_TIMEOUT_MS=15000
I set COPILOTGITHUBTOKEN but models status shows Shell env off Why
openclaw models status
reports whether
shell env import
is enabled. “Shell env: off”
does
not
mean your env vars are missing - it just means OpenClaw won’t load
your login shell automatically.
If the Gateway runs as a service (launchd/systemd), it won’t inherit your shell
environment. Fix by doing one of these:
Put the token in
~/.openclaw/.env
Copy
COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=...
Or enable shell import (
env.shellEnv.enabled: true
Or add it to your config
env
block (applies only if missing).
Then restart the gateway and recheck:
Copy

Copilot tokens are read from

Send

next
message starts a fresh session id for that chat key. This does not delete
transcripts - it just starts a new session.

multi-agent routing
and
sub-agents
. You can create one coordinator
agent and several worker agents with their own workspaces and models.
That said, this is best seen as a
fun experiment
. It is token heavy and often
less efficient than using one bot with separate sessions. The typical model we
envision is one bot you talk to, with different sessions for parallel work. That
bot can also spawn sub-agents when needed.
Docs:
Multi-agent routing
Sub-agents
Agents CLI
Why did context get truncated midtask How do I prevent it
Session context is limited by the model window. Long chats, large tool outputs, or many
files can trigger compaction or truncation.
What helps:
Ask the bot to summarize the current state and write it to a file.
Use
/compact
before long tasks, and
/new
when switching topics.
Keep important context in the workspace and ask the bot to read it back.
Use sub-agents for long or parallel work so the main chat stays smaller.
Pick a model with a larger context window if this happens often.
How do I completely reset OpenClaw but keep it installed
Use the reset command:
Copy
openclaw
reset
Non-interactive full reset:
Copy
openclaw
reset
--scope
full
--yes
--non-interactive
Then re-run onboarding:
Copy
openclaw
onboard
--install-daemon
Notes:
The onboarding wizard also offers
Reset
if it sees an existing config. See
Wizard
If you used profiles (
--profile
OPENCLAW_PROFILE
), reset each state dir (defaults are
~/.openclaw-&lt;profile&gt;
Dev reset:
openclaw gateway --dev --reset
(dev-only; wipes dev config + credentials + sessions + workspace).
Im getting context too large errors how do I reset or compact
Use one of these:
Compact
(keeps the conversation but summarizes older turns):
Copy
/compact
/compact &lt;instructions&gt;
to guide the summary.
Reset
(fresh session ID for the same chat key):
Copy
/new
/reset
If it keeps happening:
Enable or tune
session pruning
agents.defaults.contextPruning
) to trim old tool output.
Use a model with a larger context window.
Docs:
Compaction
Session pruning
Session management
Why am I seeing LLM request rejected messagesNcontentXtooluseinput Field required
This is a provider validation error: the model emitted a
tool_use
block without the required
input
. It usually means the session history is stale or corrupted (often after long threads
or a tool/schema change).
Fix: start a fresh session with
/new
(standalone message).
Why am I getting heartbeat messages every 30 minutes
Heartbeats run every
30m
by default. Tune or disable them:
Copy
agents
defaults
heartbeat
every
&quot;2h&quot;
// or &quot;0m&quot; to disable
HEARTBEAT.md
exists but is effectively empty (only blank lines and markdown
headers like
# Heading
), OpenClaw skips the heartbeat run to save API calls.
If the file is missing, the heartbeat still runs and the model decides what to do.
Per-agent overrides use
agents.list[].heartbeat
. Docs:
Heartbeat
Do I need to add a bot account to a WhatsApp group
No. OpenClaw runs on
your own account
, so if you’re in the group, OpenClaw can see it.
By default, group replies are blocked until you allow senders (
groupPolicy: &quot;allowlist&quot;
If you want only
you
to be able to trigger group replies:
Copy
channels
whatsapp
groupPolicy
&quot;allowlist&quot;
groupAllowFrom
&quot;+15551234567&quot;
How do I get the JID of a WhatsApp group
Option 1 (fastest): tail logs and send a test message in the group:
Copy
openclaw
logs
--follow
--json
Look for
chatId
(or
from
) ending in
@g.us
, like:
[email&#160;protected]
Option 2 (if already configured/allowlisted): list groups from config:
Copy
openclaw
directory
groups
list
--channel
whatsapp
Docs:
WhatsApp
Directory
Logs
Why doesnt OpenClaw reply in a group
Two common causes:
Mention gating is on (default). You must @mention the bot (or match
mentionPatterns
You configured
channels.whatsapp.groups
without
&quot;*&quot;
and the group isn’t allowlisted.
See
Groups
and
Group messages
Do groupsthreads share context with DMs
Direct chats collapse to the main session by default. Groups/channels have their own session keys, and Telegram topics / Discord threads are separate sessions. See
Groups
and
Group messages
How many workspaces and agents can I create
No hard limits. Dozens (even hundreds) are fine, but watch for:
Disk growth:
sessions + transcripts live under
~/.openclaw/agents/&lt;agentId&gt;/sessions/
Token cost:
more agents means more concurrent model usage.
Ops overhead:
per-agent auth profiles, workspaces, and channel routing.
Tips:
Keep one
active
workspace per agent (
agents.defaults.workspace
Prune old sessions (delete JSONL or store entries) if disk grows.
Use
openclaw doctor
to spot stray workspaces and profile mismatches.
Can I run multiple bots or chats at the same time Slack and how should I set that up
Yes. Use
Multi-Agent Routing
to run multiple isolated agents and route inbound messages by
channel/account/peer. Slack is supported as a channel and can be bound to specific agents.
Browser access is powerful but not “do anything a human can” - anti-bot, CAPTCHAs, and MFA can
still block automation. For the most reliable browser control, use the Chrome extension relay
on the machine that runs the browser (and keep the Gateway anywhere).
Best-practice setup:
Always-on Gateway host (VPS/Mac mini).
One agent per role (bindings).
Slack channel(s) bound to those agents.
Local browser via extension relay (or a node) when needed.

Models: defaults, selection, aliases, switching
What is the default model
OpenClaw’s default model is whatever you set as:
Copy
agents.defaults.model.primary
Models are referenced as
provider/model
(example:
anthropic/claude-opus-4-6
). If you omit the provider, OpenClaw currently assumes
anthropic
as a temporary deprecation fallback - but you should still
explicitly
set
provider/model
What model do you recommend
Recommended default:
anthropic/claude-opus-4-6
Good alternative:
anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
Reliable (less character):
openai/gpt-5.2
- nearly as good as Opus, just less personality.
Budget:
zai/glm-4.7
MiniMax M2.1 has its own docs:
MiniMax
and
Local models
Rule of thumb: use the
best model you can afford
for high-stakes work, and a cheaper
model for routine chat or summaries. You can route models per agent and use sub-agents to
parallelize long tasks (each sub-agent consumes tokens). See
Models
and
Sub-agents
Strong warning: weaker/over-quantized models are more vulnerable to prompt
injection and unsafe behavior. See
Security
More context:
Models
Can I use selfhosted models llamacpp vLLM Ollama
Yes. If your local server exposes an OpenAI-compatible API, you can point a
custom provider at it. Ollama is supported directly and is the easiest path.
Security note: smaller or heavily quantized models are more vulnerable to prompt
injection. We strongly recommend
large models
for any bot that can use tools.
If you still want small models, enable sandboxing and strict tool allowlists.

How do I switch models without wiping my config
Use
model commands
or edit only the
model
fields. Avoid full config replaces.
Safe options:
/model
in chat (quick, per-session)
openclaw models set ...
(updates just model config)
openclaw configure --section model
(interactive)
edit
agents.defaults.model
~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
Avoid
config.apply
with a partial object unless you intend to replace the whole config.
If you did overwrite config, restore from backup or re-run
openclaw doctor
to repair.

What do OpenClaw, Flawd, and Krill use for models
OpenClaw + Flawd:
Anthropic Opus (
anthropic/claude-opus-4-6
) - see
Anthropic
Krill:
MiniMax M2.1 (
minimax/MiniMax-M2.1
) - see
MiniMax
How do I switch models on the fly without restarting
Use the
/model
command as a standalone message:
Copy
/model sonnet
/model haiku
/model opus
/model gpt
/model gpt-mini
/model gemini
/model gemini-flash
You can list available models with
/model
/model list
, or
/model status
/model
(and
/model list
) shows a compact, numbered picker. Select by number:
Copy
/model 3
You can also force a specific auth profile for the provider (per session):
Copy
/model opus@anthropic:default
/model opus@anthropic:work
Tip:
/model status
shows which agent is active, which
auth-profiles.json
file is being used, and which auth profile will be tried next.
It also shows the configured provider endpoint (
baseUrl
) and API mode (
api
) when available.
How do I unpin a profile I set with profile
Re-run
/model
without
the
@profile
suffix:
Copy
/model anthropic/claude-opus-4-6
If you want to return to the default, pick it from
/model
(or send
/model &lt;default provider/model&gt;
Use
/model status
to confirm which auth profile is active.
Can I use GPT 5.2 for daily tasks and Codex 5.3 for coding
Yes. Set one as default and switch as needed:
Quick switch (per session):
/model gpt-5.2
for daily tasks,
/model gpt-5.3-codex
for coding.
Default + switch:
set
agents.defaults.model.primary
openai/gpt-5.2
, then switch to
openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex
when coding (or the other way around).
Sub-agents:
route coding tasks to sub-agents with a different default model.
See
Models
and
Slash commands
Why do I see Model is not allowed and then no reply
agents.defaults.models
is set, it becomes the
allowlist
for
/model
and any
session overrides. Choosing a model that isn’t in that list returns:
Copy
Model &quot;provider/model&quot; is not allowed. Use /model to list available models.
That error is returned
instead of
a normal reply. Fix: add the model to
agents.defaults.models
, remove the allowlist, or pick a model from
/model list
Why do I see Unknown model minimaxMiniMaxM21
This means the
provider isn’t configured
(no MiniMax provider config or auth
profile was found), so the model can’t be resolved. A fix for this detection is
2026.1.12
(unreleased at the time of writing).
Fix checklist:
Upgrade to
2026.1.12
(or run from source
main
), then restart the gateway.
Make sure MiniMax is configured (wizard or JSON), or that a MiniMax API key
exists in env/auth profiles so the provider can be injected.
Use the exact model id (case-sensitive):
minimax/MiniMax-M2.1
minimax/MiniMax-M2.1-lightning
Run:
Copy
openclaw
models
list
and pick from the list (or
/model list
in chat).
See
MiniMax
and
Models
Can I use MiniMax as my default and OpenAI for complex tasks
Yes. Use
MiniMax as the default
and switch models
per session
when needed.
Fallbacks are for
errors
, not “hard tasks,” so use
/model
or a separate agent.
Option A: switch per session
Copy
env
MINIMAX_API_KEY
&quot;sk-...&quot;
OPENAI_API_KEY
&quot;sk-...&quot;

Agent B default: OpenAI
Route by agent or use

Are opus sonnet gpt builtin shortcuts
Yes. OpenClaw ships a few default shorthands (only applied when the model exists in
agents.defaults.models
opus
anthropic/claude-opus-4-6
sonnet
anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
gpt
openai/gpt-5.2
gpt-mini
openai/gpt-5-mini
gemini
google/gemini-3-pro-preview
gemini-flash
google/gemini-3-flash-preview
If you set your own alias with the same name, your value wins.
How do I defineoverride model shortcuts aliases
Aliases come from
agents.defaults.models.&lt;modelId&gt;.alias
. Example:
Copy
agents
defaults
model
primary
&quot;anthropic/claude-opus-4-6&quot;
models
&quot;anthropic/claude-opus-4-6&quot;
alias
&quot;opus&quot;
&quot;anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5&quot;
alias
&quot;sonnet&quot;
&quot;anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5&quot;
alias
&quot;haiku&quot;
Then
/model sonnet
(or
/&lt;alias&gt;
when supported) resolves to that model ID.
How do I add models from other providers like OpenRouter or ZAI
OpenRouter (pay-per-token; many models):
Copy
agents
defaults
model
primary
&quot;openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5&quot;
models
&quot;openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5&quot;
{} }
env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY
&quot;sk-or-...&quot;
Z.AI (GLM models):
Copy
agents
defaults
model
primary
&quot;zai/glm-4.7&quot;
models
&quot;zai/glm-4.7&quot;
{} }
env
ZAI_API_KEY
&quot;...&quot;
If you reference a provider/model but the required provider key is missing, you’ll get a runtime auth error (e.g.
No API key found for provider &quot;zai&quot;
No API key found for provider after adding a new agent
This usually means the
new agent
has an empty auth store. Auth is per-agent and
stored in:
Copy
~/.openclaw/agents/&lt;agentId&gt;/agent/auth-profiles.json
Fix options:
Run
openclaw agents add &lt;id&gt;
and configure auth during the wizard.
Or copy
auth-profiles.json
from the main agent’s
agentDir
into the new agent’s
agentDir
not
reuse
agentDir
across agents; it causes auth/session collisions.
Model failover and “All models failed”
How does failover work
Failover happens in two stages:
Auth profile rotation
within the same provider.
Model fallback
to the next model in
agents.defaults.model.fallbacks
Cooldowns apply to failing profiles (exponential backoff), so OpenClaw can keep responding even when a provider is rate-limited or temporarily failing.
What does this error mean
Copy
No credentials found for profile &quot;anthropic:default&quot;
It means the system attempted to use the auth profile ID
anthropic:default
, but could not find credentials for it in the expected auth store.
Fix checklist for No credentials found for profile anthropicdefault
Confirm where auth profiles live
(new vs legacy paths)
Current:
~/.openclaw/agents/&lt;agentId&gt;/agent/auth-profiles.json
Legacy:
~/.openclaw/agent/*
(migrated by
openclaw doctor
Confirm your env var is loaded by the Gateway
If you set
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
in your shell but run the Gateway via systemd/launchd, it may not inherit it. Put it in
~/.openclaw/.env
or enable
env.shellEnv
Make sure you’re editing the correct agent
Multi-agent setups mean there can be multiple
auth-profiles.json
files.
Sanity-check model/auth status
Use
openclaw models status
to see configured models and whether providers are authenticated.
Fix checklist for No credentials found for profile anthropic
This means the run is pinned to an Anthropic auth profile, but the Gateway
can’t find it in its auth store.
Use a setup-token
Run
claude setup-token
, then paste it with
openclaw models auth setup-token --provider anthropic
If the token was created on another machine, use
openclaw models auth paste-token --provider anthropic
If you want to use an API key instead
Put
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
~/.openclaw/.env
on the
gateway host
Clear any pinned order that forces a missing profile:
Copy
openclaw
models
auth
order
clear
--provider
anthropic
Confirm you’re running commands on the gateway host
In remote mode, auth profiles live on the gateway machine, not your laptop.
Why did it also try Google Gemini and fail
If your model config includes Google Gemini as a fallback (or you switched to a Gemini shorthand), OpenClaw will try it during model fallback. If you haven’t configured Google credentials, you’ll see
No API key found for provider &quot;google&quot;
Fix: either provide Google auth, or remove/avoid Google models in
agents.defaults.model.fallbacks
/ aliases so fallback doesn’t route there.
LLM request rejected message thinking signature required google antigravity
Cause: the session history contains
thinking blocks without signatures
(often from
an aborted/partial stream). Google Antigravity requires signatures for thinking blocks.
Fix: OpenClaw now strips unsigned thinking blocks for Google Antigravity Claude. If it still appears, start a
new session
or set
/thinking off
for that agent.
Auth profiles: what they are and how to manage them
Related:
/concepts/oauth
(OAuth flows, token storage, multi-account patterns)
What is an auth profile
An auth profile is a named credential record (OAuth or API key) tied to a provider. Profiles live in:
Copy
~/.openclaw/agents/&lt;agentId&gt;/agent/auth-profiles.json
What are typical profile IDs
OpenClaw uses provider-prefixed IDs like:
anthropic:default
(common when no email identity exists)
anthropic:&lt;email&gt;
for OAuth identities
custom IDs you choose (e.g.
anthropic:work
Can I control which auth profile is tried first
Yes. Config supports optional metadata for profiles and an ordering per provider (
auth.order.&lt;provider&gt;
). This does
not
store secrets; it maps IDs to provider/mode and sets rotation order.
OpenClaw may temporarily skip a profile if it’s in a short
cooldown
(rate limits/timeouts/auth failures) or a longer
disabled
state (billing/insufficient credits). To inspect this, run
openclaw models status --json
and check
auth.unusableProfiles
. Tuning:
auth.cooldowns.billingBackoffHours*
You can also set a
per-agent
order override (stored in that agent’s
auth-profiles.json
) via the CLI:
Copy
# Defaults to the configured default agent (omit --agent)
openclaw
models
auth
order
get
--provider
anthropic
# Lock rotation to a single profile (only try this one)
openclaw
models
auth
order
set
--provider
anthropic
anthropic:default
# Or set an explicit order (fallback within provider)
openclaw
models
auth
order
set
--provider
anthropic
anthropic:work
anthropic:default
# Clear override (fall back to config auth.order / round-robin)
openclaw
models
auth
order
clear
--provider
anthropic
To target a specific agent:
Copy
openclaw
models
auth
order
set
--provider
anthropic
--agent
main
anthropic:default
OAuth vs API key whats the difference
OpenClaw supports both:
OAuth
often leverages subscription access (where applicable).
API keys
use pay-per-token billing.
The wizard explicitly supports Anthropic setup-token and OpenAI Codex OAuth and can store API keys for you.
Gateway: ports, “already running”, and remote mode
What port does the Gateway use
gateway.port
controls the single multiplexed port for WebSocket + HTTP (Control UI, hooks, etc.).
Precedence:
Copy
--port &gt; OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT &gt; gateway.port &gt; default 18789
Why does openclaw gateway status say Runtime running but RPC probe failed
Because “running” is the
supervisor’s
view (launchd/systemd/schtasks). The RPC probe is the CLI actually connecting to the gateway WebSocket and calling
status
Use
openclaw gateway status
and trust these lines:
Probe target:
(the URL the probe actually used)
Listening:
(what’s actually bound on the port)
Last gateway error:
(common root cause when the process is alive but the port isn’t listening)
Why does openclaw gateway status show Config cli and Config service different
You’re editing one config file while the service is running another (often a
--profile
OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR
mismatch).
Fix:
Copy
openclaw
gateway
install
--force
Run that from the same
--profile
/ environment you want the service to use.
What does another gateway instance is already listening mean
OpenClaw enforces a runtime lock by binding the WebSocket listener immediately on startup (default
ws://127.0.0.1:18789
). If the bind fails with
EADDRINUSE
, it throws
GatewayLockError
indicating another instance is already listening.
Fix: stop the other instance, free the port, or run with
openclaw gateway --port &lt;port&gt;
How do I run OpenClaw in remote mode client connects to a Gateway elsewhere
Set
gateway.mode: &quot;remote&quot;
and point to a remote WebSocket URL, optionally with a token/password:
Copy
gateway
mode
&quot;remote&quot;
remote
url
&quot;ws://gateway.tailnet:18789&quot;
token
&quot;your-token&quot;
password
&quot;your-password&quot;
Notes:
openclaw gateway
only starts when
gateway.mode
local
(or you pass the override flag).
The macOS app watches the config file and switches modes live when these values change.
The Control UI says unauthorized or keeps reconnecting What now
Your gateway is running with auth enabled (
gateway.auth.*
), but the UI is not sending the matching token/password.
Facts (from code):
The Control UI stores the token in browser localStorage key
openclaw.control.settings.v1
Fix:
Fastest:
openclaw dashboard
(prints + copies the dashboard URL, tries to open; shows SSH hint if headless).
If you don’t have a token yet:
openclaw doctor --generate-gateway-token
If remote, tunnel first:
ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@host
then open
http://127.0.0.1:18789/
Set
gateway.auth.token
(or
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN
) on the gateway host.
In the Control UI settings, paste the same token.
Still stuck? Run
openclaw status --all
and follow

I set gatewaybind tailnet but it cant bind nothing listens
tailnet
bind picks a Tailscale IP from your network interfaces (100.64.0.0/10). If the machine isn’t on Tailscale (or the interface is down), there’s nothing to bind to.
Fix:
Start Tailscale on that host (so it has a 100.x address), or
Switch to
gateway.bind: &quot;loopback&quot;
&quot;lan&quot;
Note:
tailnet
is explicit.
auto
prefers loopback; use
gateway.bind: &quot;tailnet&quot;
when you want a tailnet-only bind.
Can I run multiple Gateways on the same host
Usually no - one Gateway can run multiple messaging channels and agents. Use multiple Gateways only when you need redundancy (ex: rescue bot) or hard isolation.
Yes, but you must isolate:
OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH
(per-instance config)
OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR
(per-instance state)
agents.defaults.workspace
(workspace isolation)
gateway.port
(unique ports)
Quick setup (recommended):
Use
openclaw --profile &lt;name&gt; …
per instance (auto-creates
~/.openclaw-&lt;name&gt;
Set a unique
gateway.port
in each profile config (or pass
--port
for manual runs).
Install a per-profile service:
openclaw --profile &lt;name&gt; gateway install
Profiles also suffix service names (
bot.molt.&lt;profile&gt;
; legacy
com.openclaw.*
openclaw-gateway-&lt;profile&gt;.service
OpenClaw Gateway (&lt;profile&gt;)
Full guide:
Multiple gateways
What does invalid handshake code 1008 mean
The Gateway is a
WebSocket server
, and it expects the very first message to
be a
connect
frame. If it receives anything else, it closes the connection
with
code 1008
(policy violation).
Common causes:
You opened the
HTTP
URL in a browser (
http://...
) instead of a WS client.
You used the wrong port or path.
A proxy or tunnel stripped auth headers or sent a non-Gateway request.
Quick fixes:
Use the WS URL:
ws://&lt;host&gt;:18789
(or
wss://...
if HTTPS).
Don’t open the WS port in a normal browser tab.
If auth is on, include the token/password in the
connect
frame.
If you’re using the CLI or TUI, the URL should look like:
Copy
openclaw tui --url ws://&lt;host&gt;:18789 --token &lt;token&gt;

Logging and debugging
Where are logs
File logs (structured):
Copy
/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-YYYY-MM-DD.log
You can set a stable path via
logging.file
. File log level is controlled by
logging.level
. Console verbosity is controlled by
--verbose
and
logging.consoleLevel
Fastest log tail:
Copy
openclaw

--follow
Service/supervisor logs (when the gateway runs via launchd/systemd):
macOS:
$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/logs/gateway.log
and
gateway.err.log
(default:

openclaw gateway restart
If you never installed the service, start it in the foreground:
Copy

openclaw gateway restart
If you run it manually (no service), use:
Copy
openclaw gateway run

Slash commands
How do I completely stop then start the Gateway
If you installed the service:
Copy
openclaw
gateway
stop
openclaw
gateway
start
This stops/starts the
supervised service
(launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux).
Use this when the Gateway runs in the background as a daemon.
If you’re running in the foreground, stop with Ctrl-C, then:
Copy
openclaw
gateway
run
Docs:
Gateway service runbook
ELI5 openclaw gateway restart vs openclaw gateway
openclaw gateway restart
: restarts the
background service
(launchd/systemd).
openclaw gateway
: runs the gateway
in the foreground
for this terminal session.
If you installed the service, use the gateway commands. Use
openclaw gateway
when
you want a one-off, foreground run.
What’s the fastest way to get more details when something fails
Start the Gateway with
--verbose
to get more console detail. Then inspect the log file for channel auth, model routing, and RPC errors.
Media and attachments
My skill generated an imagePDF but nothing was sent
Outbound attachments from the agent must include a
MEDIA:&lt;path-or-url&gt;
line (on its own line). See
OpenClaw assistant setup
and
Agent send
CLI sending:
Copy
openclaw

send
--target

&quot;Here you go&quot;
--media

Also check:
The target channel supports outbound media and isn’t blocked by allowlists.
The file is within the provider’s size limits (images are resized to max 2048px).

Security and access control
Is it safe to expose OpenClaw to inbound DMs
Treat inbound DMs as untrusted input. Defaults are designed to reduce risk:
Default behavior on DM-capable channels is
pairing
Unknown senders receive a pairing code; the bot does not process their message.
Approve with:
openclaw pairing approve &lt;channel&gt; &lt;code&gt;
Pending requests are capped at
3 per channel
; check
openclaw pairing list &lt;channel&gt;
if a code didn’t arrive.
Opening DMs publicly requires explicit opt-in (
dmPolicy: &quot;open&quot;
and allowlist
&quot;*&quot;
Run
openclaw doctor
to surface risky DM policies.
Is prompt injection only a concern for public bots
No. Prompt injection is about
untrusted content
, not just who can DM the bot.
If your assistant reads external content (web search/fetch, browser pages, emails,
docs, attachments, pasted logs), that content can include instructions that try
to hijack the model. This can happen even if
you are the only sender
The biggest risk is when tools are enabled: the model can be tricked into
exfiltrating context or calling tools on your behalf. Reduce the blast radius by:
using a read-only or tool-disabled “reader” agent to summarize untrusted content
keeping
web_search
web_fetch
browser
off for tool-enabled agents
sandboxing and strict tool allowlists
Details:
Security
Should my bot have its own email GitHub account or phone number
Yes, for most setups. Isolating the bot with separate accounts and phone numbers
reduces the blast radius if something goes wrong. This also makes it easier to rotate
credentials or revoke access without impacting your personal accounts.
Start small. Give access only to the tools and accounts you actually need, and expand
later if required.
Docs:
Security
Pairing
Can I give it autonomy over my text messages and is that safe
We do
not
recommend full autonomy over your personal messages. The safest pattern is:
Keep DMs in
pairing mode
or a tight allowlist.
Use a
separate number or account
if you want it to message on your behalf.
Let it draft, then
approve before sending
If you want to experiment, do it on a dedicated account and keep it isolated. See
Security
Can I use cheaper models for personal assistant tasks
Yes,
the agent is chat-only and the input is trusted. Smaller tiers are
more susceptible to instruction hijacking, so avoid them for tool-enabled agents
or when reading untrusted content. If you must use a smaller model, lock down
tools and run inside a sandbox. See
Security
I ran start in Telegram but didnt get a pairing code
Pairing codes are sent
only
when an unknown sender messages the bot and
dmPolicy: &quot;pairing&quot;
is enabled.
/start
by itself doesn’t generate a code.
Check pending requests:
Copy
openclaw
pairing
list
telegram
If you want immediate access, allowlist your sender id or set
dmPolicy: &quot;open&quot;
for that account.
WhatsApp will it message my contacts How does pairing work
No. Default WhatsApp DM policy is
pairing
. Unknown senders only get a pairing code and their message is
not processed
. OpenClaw only replies to chats it receives or to explicit sends you trigger.
Approve pairing with:
Copy
openclaw
pairing
approve
whatsapp
&lt;
cod
&gt;
List pending requests:
Copy
openclaw
pairing
list
whatsapp
Wizard phone number prompt: it’s used to set your
allowlist/owner
so your own DMs are permitted. It’s not used for auto-sending. If you run on your personal WhatsApp number, use that number and enable
channels.whatsapp.selfChatMode
Chat commands, aborting tasks, and “it won’t stop”
How do I stop internal system messages from showing in chat
Most internal or tool messages only appear when
verbose
reasoning
is enabled
for that session.
Fix in the chat where you see it:
Copy
/verbose off
/reasoning off
If it is still noisy, check the session settings in the Control UI and set verbose
inherit
. Also confirm you are not using a bot profile with
verboseDefault
set
in config.
Docs:
Thinking and verbose
Security
How do I stopcancel a running task
Send any of these
as a standalone message
(no slash):
Copy
stop
abort
esc
wait
exit
interrupt
These are abort triggers (not slash commands).
For background processes (from the exec tool), you can ask the agent to run:
Copy
process action:kill sessionId:XXX
Slash commands overview: see
Slash commands
Most commands must be sent as a
standalone
message that starts with
, but a few shortcuts (like
/status
) also work inline for allowlisted senders.
How do I send a Discord message from Telegram Crosscontext messaging denied
OpenClaw blocks
cross-provider
messaging by default. If a tool call is bound
to Telegram, it won’t send to Discord unless you explicitly allow it.
Enable cross-provider messaging for the agent:
Copy
agents
defaults
tools
message
crossContext
allowAcrossProviders
true
marker
enabled
true
prefix
&quot;[from {channel}] &quot;
Restart the gateway after editing config. If you only want this for a single
agent, set it under
agents.list[].tools.message
instead.
Why does it feel like the bot ignores rapidfire messages
Queue mode controls how new messages interact with an in-flight run. Use
/queue
to change modes:
steer
- new messages redirect the current task
followup
- run messages one at a time
collect
- batch messages and reply once (default)
steer-backlog
- steer now, then process backlog
interrupt
- abort current run and start fresh
You can add options like
debounce:2s cap:25 drop:summarize
for followup modes.
Answer the exact question from the screenshot/chat log
Q: “What’s the default model for Anthropic with an API key?”
In OpenClaw, credentials and model selection are separate. Setting
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
(or storing an Anthropic API key in auth profiles) enables authentication, but the actual default model is whatever you configure in
agents.defaults.model.primary
(for example,
anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
anthropic/claude-opus-4-6
). If you see
No credentials found for profile &quot;anthropic:default&quot;
, it means the Gateway couldn’t find Anthropic credentials in the expected
auth-profiles.json
for the agent that’s running.

OpenClaw has three Vitest suites (unit/integration, e2e, live) and a small set of Docker runners.
This doc is a “how we test” guide:
What each suite covers (and what it deliberately does
not
cover)
Which commands to run for common workflows (local, pre-push, debugging)
How live tests discover credentials and select models/providers
How to add regressions for real-world model/provider issues
Quick start
Most days:
Full gate (expected before push):
pnpm build &amp;&amp; pnpm check &amp;&amp; pnpm test
When you touch tests or want extra confidence:
Coverage gate:
pnpm test:coverage
E2E suite:
pnpm test:e2e
When debugging real providers/models (requires real creds):
Live suite (models + gateway tool/image probes):
pnpm test:live
Tip: when you only need one failing case, prefer narrowing live tests via the allowlist env vars described below.
Test suites (what runs where)
Think of the suites as “increasing realism” (and increasing flakiness/cost):
Unit / integration (default)
Command:
pnpm test
Config:
scripts/test-parallel.mjs
(runs
vitest.unit.config.ts
vitest.extensions.config.ts
vitest.gateway.config.ts
Files:
src/**/*.test.ts
extensions/**/*.test.ts
Scope:
Pure unit tests
In-process integration tests (gateway auth, routing, tooling, parsing, config)
Deterministic regressions for known bugs
Expectations:
Runs in CI
No real keys required
Should be fast and stable
Pool note:
OpenClaw uses Vitest
vmForks
on Node 22/23 for faster unit shards.
On Node 24+, OpenClaw automatically falls back to regular
forks
to avoid Node VM linking errors (
ERR_VM_MODULE_LINK_FAILURE
module is already linked
Override manually with
OPENCLAW_TEST_VM_FORKS=0
(force
forks
) or
OPENCLAW_TEST_VM_FORKS=1
(force
vmForks
E2E (gateway smoke)
Command:
pnpm test:e2e
Config:
vitest.e2e.config.ts
Files:
src/**/*.e2e.test.ts
Runtime defaults:
Uses Vitest
vmForks
for faster file startup.
Uses adaptive workers (CI: 2-4, local: 4-8).
Runs in silent mode by default to reduce console I/O overhead.
Useful overrides:
OPENCLAW_E2E_WORKERS=&lt;n&gt;
to force worker count (capped at 16).
OPENCLAW_E2E_VERBOSE=1
to re-enable verbose console output.
Scope:
Multi-instance gateway end-to-end behavior
WebSocket/HTTP surfaces, node pairing, and heavier networking
Expectations:
Runs in CI (when enabled in the pipeline)
No real keys required
More moving parts than unit tests (can be slower)
Live (real providers + real models)
Command:
pnpm test:live
Config:
vitest.live.config.ts
Files:
src/**/*.live.test.ts
Default:
enabled
pnpm test:live
(sets
OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1
Scope:
“Does this provider/model actually work
today
with real creds?”
Catch provider format changes, tool-calling quirks, auth issues, and rate limit behavior
Expectations:
Not CI-stable by design (real networks, real provider policies, quotas, outages)
Costs money / uses rate limits
Prefer running narrowed subsets instead of “everything”
Live runs will source
~/.profile
to pick up missing API keys
Anthropic key rotation: set
OPENCLAW_LIVE_ANTHROPIC_KEYS=&quot;sk-...,sk-...&quot;
(or
OPENCLAW_LIVE_ANTHROPIC_KEY=sk-...
) or multiple
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY*
vars; tests will retry on rate limits
Which suite should I run?
Use this decision table:
Editing logic/tests: run
pnpm test
(and
pnpm test:coverage
if you changed a lot)
Touching gateway networking / WS protocol / pairing: add
pnpm test:e2e
Debugging “my bot is down” / provider-specific failures / tool calling: run a narrowed
pnpm test:live
Live: model smoke (profile keys)
Live tests are split into two layers so we can isolate failures:
“Direct model” tells us the provider/model can answer at all with the given key.
“Gateway smoke” tells us the full gateway+agent pipeline works for that model (sessions, history, tools, sandbox policy, etc.).
Layer 1: Direct model completion (no gateway)
Test:
src/agents/models.profiles.live.test.ts
Goal:
Enumerate discovered models
Use
getApiKeyForModel
to select models you have creds for
Run a small completion per model (and targeted regressions where needed)
How to enable:
pnpm test:live
(or
OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1
if invoking Vitest directly)
Set
OPENCLAW_LIVE_MODELS=modern
(or
all
, alias for modern) to actually run this suite; otherwise it skips to keep
pnpm test:live
focused on gateway smoke
How to select models:
OPENCLAW_LIVE_MODELS=modern
to run the modern allowlist (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku 4.5, GPT-5.x + Codex, Gemini 3, GLM 4.7, MiniMax M2.1, Grok 4)
OPENCLAW_LIVE_MODELS=all
is an alias for the modern allowlist
OPENCLAW_LIVE_MODELS=&quot;openai/gpt-5.2,anthropic/claude-opus-4-6,...&quot;
(comma allowlist)
How to select providers:
OPENCLAW_LIVE_PROVIDERS=&quot;google,google-antigravity,google-gemini-cli&quot;
(comma allowlist)
Where keys come from:
By default: profile store and env fallbacks
Set
OPENCLAW_LIVE_REQUIRE_PROFILE_KEYS=1
to enforce
profile store
only
Why this exists:
Separates “provider API is broken / key is invalid” from “gateway agent pipeline is broken”
Contains small, isolated regressions (example: OpenAI Responses/Codex Responses reasoning replay + tool-call flows)
Layer 2: Gateway + dev agent smoke (what “@openclaw” actually does)
Test:
src/gateway/gateway-models.profiles.live.test.ts
Goal:
Spin up an in-process gateway
Create/patch a
agent:dev:*
session (model override per run)
Iterate models-with-keys and assert:
“meaningful” response (no tools)
a real tool invocation works (read probe)
optional extra tool probes (exec+read probe)
OpenAI regression paths (tool-call-only → follow-up) keep working
Probe details (so you can explain failures quickly):
read
probe: the test writes a nonce file in the workspace and asks the agent to
read
it and echo the nonce back.
exec+read
probe: the test asks the agent to
exec
-write a nonce into a temp file, then
read
it back.
image probe: the test attaches a generated PNG (cat + randomized code) and expects the model to return
cat &lt;CODE&gt;
Implementation reference:
src/gateway/gateway-models.profiles.live.test.ts
and
src/gateway/live-image-probe.ts
How to enable:
pnpm test:live
(or
OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1
if invoking Vitest directly)
How to select models:
Default: modern allowlist (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku 4.5, GPT-5.x + Codex, Gemini 3, GLM 4.7, MiniMax M2.1, Grok 4)
OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_MODELS=all
is an alias for the modern allowlist
Or set
OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_MODELS=&quot;provider/model&quot;
(or comma list) to narrow
How to select providers (avoid “OpenRouter everything”):
OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_PROVIDERS=&quot;google,google-antigravity,google-gemini-cli,openai,anthropic,zai,minimax&quot;
(comma allowlist)
Tool + image probes are always on in this live test:
read
probe +
exec+read
probe (tool stress)
image probe runs when the model advertises image input support
Flow (high level):
Test generates a tiny PNG with “CAT” + random code (
src/gateway/live-image-probe.ts
Sends it via
agent
attachments: [{ mimeType: &quot;image/png&quot;, content: &quot;&lt;base64&gt;&quot; }]
Gateway parses attachments into
images[]
src/gateway/server-methods/agent.ts
src/gateway/chat-attachments.ts
Embedded agent forwards a multimodal user message to the model
Assertion: reply contains
cat
+ the code (OCR tolerance: minor mistakes allowed)
Tip: to see what you can test on your machine (and the exact
provider/model
ids), run:
Copy

list

Live: Anthropic setup-token smoke
Test:
src/agents/anthropic.setup-token.live.test.ts
Goal: verify Claude Code CLI setup-token (or a pasted setup-token profile) can complete an Anthropic prompt.
Enable:
pnpm test:live
(or
OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1
if invoking Vitest directly)
OPENCLAW_LIVE_SETUP_TOKEN=1
Token sources (pick one):
Profile:
OPENCLAW_LIVE_SETUP_TOKEN_PROFILE=anthropic:setup-token-test
Raw token:
OPENCLAW_LIVE_SETUP_TOKEN_VALUE=sk-ant-oat01-...
Model override (optional):

OPENCLAW_LIVE_CLI_BACKEND_IMAGE_PROBE=1
to send a real image attachment (paths are injected into the prompt).
OPENCLAW_LIVE_CLI_BACKEND_IMAGE_ARG=&quot;--image&quot;
to pass image file paths as CLI args instead of prompt injection.
OPENCLAW_LIVE_CLI_BACKEND_IMAGE_MODE=&quot;repeat&quot;
(or
&quot;list&quot;
) to control how image args are passed when
IMAGE_ARG
is set.
OPENCLAW_LIVE_CLI_BACKEND_RESUME_PROBE=1

Recommended live recipes
Narrow, explicit allowlists are fastest and least flaky:
Single model, direct (no gateway):
OPENCLAW_LIVE_MODELS=&quot;openai/gpt-5.2&quot; pnpm test:live src/agents/models.profiles.live.test.ts
Single model, gateway smoke:
OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_MODELS=&quot;openai/gpt-5.2&quot; pnpm test:live src/gateway/gateway-models.profiles.live.test.ts
Tool calling across several providers:
OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_MODELS=&quot;openai/gpt-5.2,anthropic/claude-opus-4-6,google/gemini-3-flash-preview,zai/glm-4.7,minimax/minimax-m2.1&quot; pnpm test:live src/gateway/gateway-models.profiles.live.test.ts
Google focus (Gemini API key + Antigravity):
Gemini (API key):
OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_MODELS=&quot;google/gemini-3-flash-preview&quot; pnpm test:live src/gateway/gateway-models.profiles.live.test.ts
Antigravity (OAuth):
OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_MODELS=&quot;google-antigravity/claude-opus-4-6-thinking,google-antigravity/gemini-3-pro-high&quot; pnpm test:live src/gateway/gateway-models.profiles.live.test.ts
Notes:
google/...
uses the Gemini API (API key).
google-antigravity/...
uses the Antigravity OAuth bridge (Cloud Code Assist-style agent endpoint).
google-gemini-cli/...
uses the local Gemini CLI on your machine (separate auth + tooling quirks).
Gemini API vs Gemini CLI:
API: OpenClaw calls Google’s hosted Gemini API over HTTP (API key / profile auth); this is what most users mean by “Gemini”.
CLI: OpenClaw shells out to a local
gemini
binary; it has its own auth and can behave differently (streaming/tool support/version skew).
Live: model matrix (what we cover)
There is no fixed “CI model list” (live is opt-in), but these are the
recommended
models to cover regularly on a dev machine with keys.
Modern smoke set (tool calling + image)
This is the “common models” run we expect to keep working:
OpenAI (non-Codex):
openai/gpt-5.2
(optional:
openai/gpt-5.1
OpenAI Codex:
openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex
(optional:
openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex-codex
Anthropic:
anthropic/claude-opus-4-6
(or
anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
Google (Gemini API):
google/gemini-3-pro-preview
and
google/gemini-3-flash-preview
(avoid older Gemini 2.x models)
Google (Antigravity):
google-antigravity/claude-opus-4-6-thinking
and
google-antigravity/gemini-3-flash
Z.AI (GLM):
zai/glm-4.7
MiniMax:
minimax/minimax-m2.1
Run gateway smoke with tools + image:
OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_MODELS=&quot;openai/gpt-5.2,openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex,anthropic/claude-opus-4-6,google/gemini-3-pro-preview,google/gemini-3-flash-preview,google-antigravity/claude-opus-4-6-thinking,google-antigravity/gemini-3-flash,zai/glm-4.7,minimax/minimax-m2.1&quot; pnpm test:live src/gateway/gateway-models.profiles.live.test.ts
Baseline: tool calling (Read + optional Exec)
Pick at least one per provider family:
OpenAI:
openai/gpt-5.2

openai/gpt-5-mini
Anthropic:
anthropic/claude-opus-4-6
(or
anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5

google/gemini-3-flash-preview
(or
google/gemini-3-pro-preview
Z.AI (GLM):
zai/glm-4.7
MiniMax:
minimax/minimax-m2.1
Optional additional coverage (nice to have):
xAI:
xai/grok-4
(or latest available)
Mistral:
mistral/
… (pick one “tools” capable model you have enabled)
Cerebras:
cerebras/
… (if you have access)
LM Studio:
lmstudio/
… (local; tool calling depends on API mode)
Vision: image send (attachment → multimodal message)
Include at least one image-capable model in
OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_MODELS
(Claude/Gemini/OpenAI vision-capable variants, etc.) to exercise the image probe.
Aggregators / alternate gateways
If you have keys enabled, we also support testing via:
OpenRouter:
openrouter/...
(hundreds of models; use
openclaw models scan
to find tool+image capable candidates)
OpenCode Zen:
opencode/...
(auth via
OPENCODE_API_KEY
OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY
More providers you can include in the live matrix (if you have creds/config):

Via
models.providers
(custom endpoints):
minimax
(cloud/API), plus any OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible proxy (LM Studio, vLLM, LiteLLM, etc.)
Tip: don’t try to hardcode “all models” in docs. The authoritative list is whatever
discoverModels(...)
returns on your machine + whatever keys are available.
Credentials (never commit)
Live tests discover credentials the same way the CLI does. Practical implications:
If the CLI works, live tests should find the same keys.
If a live test says “no creds”, debug the same way you’d debug
openclaw models list
/ model selection.
Profile store:
~/.openclaw/credentials/
(preferred; what “profile keys” means in the tests)
Config:
~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
(or
OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH
If you want to rely on env keys (e.g. exported in your
~/.profile
), run local tests after
source ~/.profile
, or use the Docker runners below (they can mount
~/.profile
into the container).
Deepgram live (audio transcription)
Test:
src/media-understanding/providers/deepgram/audio.live.test.ts
Enable:
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=... DEEPGRAM_LIVE_TEST=1 pnpm test:live src/media-understanding/providers/deepgram/audio.live.test.ts
Docker runners (optional “works in Linux” checks)
These run
pnpm test:live
inside the repo Docker image, mounting your local config dir and workspace (and sourcing
~/.profile
if mounted):
Direct models:
pnpm test:docker:live-models
(script:
scripts/test-live-models-docker.sh
Gateway + dev agent:
pnpm test:docker:live-gateway
(script:
scripts/test-live-gateway-models-docker.sh
Onboarding wizard (TTY, full scaffolding):
pnpm test:docker:onboard
(script:
scripts/e2e/onboard-docker.sh
Gateway networking (two containers, WS auth + health):
pnpm test:docker:gateway-network
(script:
scripts/e2e/gateway-network-docker.sh
Plugins (custom extension load + registry smoke):
pnpm test:docker:plugins
(script:
scripts/e2e/plugins-docker.sh
Useful env vars:
OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR=...
(default:
~/.openclaw
) mounted to
/home/node/.openclaw
OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR=...
(default:
~/.openclaw/workspace
) mounted to
/home/node/.openclaw/workspace
OPENCLAW_PROFILE_FILE=...
(default:
~/.profile
) mounted to
/home/node/.profile
and sourced before running tests
OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_MODELS=...
OPENCLAW_LIVE_MODELS=...
to narrow the run
OPENCLAW_LIVE_REQUIRE_PROFILE_KEYS=1
to ensure creds come from the profile store (not env)
Docs sanity
Run docs checks after doc edits:
pnpm docs:list
Offline regression (CI-safe)
These are “real pipeline” regressions without real providers:
Gateway tool calling (mock OpenAI, real gateway + agent loop):
src/gateway/gateway.tool-calling.mock-openai.test.ts
Gateway wizard (WS
wizard.start
wizard.next
, writes config + auth enforced):
src/gateway/gateway.wizard.e2e.test.ts
Agent reliability evals (skills)
We already have a few CI-safe tests that behave like “agent reliability evals”:
Mock tool-calling through the real gateway + agent loop (
src/gateway/gateway.tool-calling.mock-openai.test.ts
End-to-end wizard flows that validate session wiring and config effects (
src/gateway/gateway.wizard.e2e.test.ts
What’s still missing for skills (see
Skills
Decisioning:
when skills are listed in the prompt, does the agent pick the right skill (or avoid irrelevant ones)?
Compliance:
does the agent read
SKILL.md
before use and follow required steps/args?
Workflow contracts:
multi-turn scenarios that assert tool order, session history carryover, and sandbox boundaries.
Future evals should stay deterministic first:
A scenario runner using mock providers to assert tool calls + order, skill file reads, and session wiring.
A small suite of skill-focused scenarios (use vs avoid, gating, prompt injection).
Optional live evals (opt-in, env-gated) only after the CI-safe suite is in place.
Adding regressions (guidance)
When you fix a provider/model issue discovered in live:
Add a CI-safe regression if possible (mock/stub provider, or capture the exact request-shape transformation)
If it’s inherently live-only (rate limits, auth policies), keep the live test narrow and opt-in via env vars
Prefer targeting the smallest layer that catches the bug:
provider request conversion/replay bug → direct models test
gateway session/history/tool pipeline bug → gateway live smoke or CI-safe gateway mock test
