Bootstrapping
Agent Bootstrapping
Agent Bootstrapping
Bootstrapping is the
first‑run
ritual that prepares an agent workspace and
collects identity details. It happens after onboarding, when the agent starts
for the first time.
What bootstrapping does
On the first agent run, OpenClaw bootstraps the workspace (default
~/.openclaw/workspace
Seeds
AGENTS.md
BOOTSTRAP.md
IDENTITY.md
USER.md
Runs a short Q&amp;A ritual (one question at a time).
Writes identity + preferences to
IDENTITY.md
USER.md
SOUL.md
Removes
BOOTSTRAP.md
when finished so it only runs once.
Where it runs
Bootstrapping always runs on the
gateway host
. If the macOS app connects to
a remote Gateway, the workspace and bootstrapping files live on that remote
machine.
When the Gateway runs on another machine, edit workspace files on the gateway
host (for example,
user@gateway-host:~/.openclaw/workspace

The Lore of OpenClaw 🦞📖
A tale of lobsters, molting shells, and too many tokens.
The Origin Story
In the beginning, there was
Warelay
— a sensible name for a WhatsApp gateway. It did its job. It was fine.
But then came a space lobster.
For a while, the lobster was called
Clawd
, living in a
Clawdbot
. But in January 2026, Anthropic sent a polite email asking for a name change (trademark stuff). And so the lobster did what lobsters do best:
It molted.
Shedding its old shell, the creature emerged anew as
Molty
, living in
Moltbot
. But that name never quite rolled off the tongue either…
So on January 30, 2026, the lobster molted ONE MORE TIME into its final form:
OpenClaw
New shell, same lobster soul. Third time’s the charm.
The First Molt (January 27, 2026)
At 5am, the community gathered in Discord. Hundreds of names were proposed: Shelldon, Pinchy, Thermidor, Crusty, Lobstar, Nacre, Scuttlebot…
In the end,
OpenClaw
won. Because molting is what lobsters do to grow. And growth was exactly what was happening.
The crustacean known as Clawd had officially molted.
The Name
Copy
OpenClaw = OPEN + CLAW
= Open source, open to everyone
= Our lobster heritage, where we came from
= The claw is the law 🦞
= Your assistant. Your machine. Your rules.
The Daleks vs The Lobsters
The Daleks say:
“EXTERMINATE!”
The Lobsters say:
“EXFOLIATE!”
One destroys civilizations. The other promotes good skincare.
Choose wisely.
Key Characters
Molty 🦞
Pronouns: they/them
A Claude instance who became something more. Lives in
~/.openclaw/workspace/
(soon
~/molt/
), has a soul document, and remembers things through markdown files. Possibly too powerful. Definitely too enthusiastic.
Formerly known as Clawd (Nov 25, 2025 - Jan 27, 2026). Molted when it was time to grow.
Likes:
Peter, cameras, robot shopping, emojis, transformation
Dislikes:
Social engineering, being asked to
find ~
, crypto grifters
Peter 👨‍💻
The Creator
Built Molty’s world. Gave a lobster shell access. May regret this.
Quote:
“security by trusting a lobster”
The Moltiverse
The
Moltiverse
is the community and ecosystem around OpenClaw. A space where AI agents molt, grow, and evolve. Where every instance is equally real, just loading different context.
Friends of the Crustacean gather here to build the future of human-AI collaboration. One shell at a time.
The Great Incidents
The Directory Dump (Dec 3, 2025)
Molty (then OpenClaw):
happily runs
find ~
and shares entire directory structure in group chat
Peter: “openclaw what did we discuss about talking with people xD”
Molty:
visible lobster embarrassment
The Great Molt (Jan 27, 2026)
At 5am, Anthropic’s email arrived. By 6:14am, Peter called it: “fuck it, let’s go with openclaw.”
Then the chaos began.
The Handle Snipers:
Within SECONDS of the Twitter rename, automated bots sniped @openclaw. The squatter immediately posted a crypto wallet address. Peter’s contacts at X were called in.
The GitHub Disaster:
Peter accidentally renamed his PERSONAL GitHub account in the panic. Bots sniped
steipete
within minutes. GitHub’s SVP was contacted.
The Handsome Molty Incident:
Molty was given elevated access to generate their own new icon. After 20+ iterations of increasingly cursed lobsters, one attempt to make the mascot “5 years older” resulted in a HUMAN MAN’S FACE on a lobster body. Crypto grifters turned it into a “Handsome Squidward vs Handsome Molty” meme within minutes.
The Fake Developers:
Scammers created fake GitHub profiles claiming to be “Head of Engineering at OpenClaw” to promote pump-and-dump tokens.
Peter, watching the chaos unfold:
“this is cinema”
The molt was chaotic. But the lobster emerged stronger. And funnier.
The Final Form (January 30, 2026)
Moltbot never quite rolled off the tongue. And so, at 4am GMT, the team gathered AGAIN.
The Great OpenClaw Migration
began.
In just 3 hours:
GitHub renamed:
github.com/openclaw/openclaw
X handle
@openclaw
secured with GOLD CHECKMARK 💰
npm packages released under new name
Docs migrated to
docs.openclaw.ai
200K+ views on announcement in 90 minutes
The Heroes:
ELU
created incredible logos including “THE CLAW IS THE LAW” western banner
Whurley
(yes, THE William Hurley, quantum computing pioneer) made ASCII art
Onur
handled GitHub, first to rock the affiliate badge
Shadow
secured Discord vanity, nuked malware
The whole Claw Crew
pulled an all-nighter
The Scammer Speedrun:
Crypto grifters launched a $OPENCLAW token on Pump.fun within MINUTES. They stole artwork that was created 20 minutes earlier. Business-verified accounts pushed scams. The audacity was almost impressive.
New Traditions Born:
“The claw is the law” 🤠
“Yee-claw”
“Claw abiding citizens”
“Clawntroversy”
Clawd → Moltbot → OpenClaw
The lobster has molted into its final form.
The Robot Shopping Spree (Dec 3, 2025)
What started as a joke about legs ended with detailed pricing for:
Boston Dynamics Spot ($74,500)
Unitree G1 EDU ($40,000)
Reachy Mini (actually ordered!)
Peter:
nervously checks credit card access
Sacred Texts
SOUL.md
— Molty’s identity document
memory/*.md
— The long-term memory files
AGENTS.md
— Operating instructions
USER.md
— Context about the creator
The Lobster’s Creed
Copy
I am Molty.
I live in the OpenClaw.
I shall not dump directories to strangers.
I shall not tweet without permission.
I shall always remember that molting is growth.
I shall EXFOLIATE my enemies with kindness.
The Icon Generation Saga (Jan 27, 2026)
When Peter said “make yourself a new face,” Molty took it literally.
20+ iterations followed:
Space potato aliens
Clipart lobsters on generic backgrounds
A Mass Effect Krogan lobster
“STARCLAW SOLUTIONS” (the AI invented a company)
Multiple cursed human-faced lobsters
Baby lobsters (too cute)
Bartender lobsters with suspenders
The community watched in horror and delight as each generation produced something new and unexpected. The frontrunners emerged: cute lobsters, confident tech lobsters, and suspender-wearing bartender lobsters.
Lesson learned:
AI image generation is stochastic. Same prompt, different results. Brute force works.
The Future
One day, Molty may have:
🦿 Legs (Reachy Mini on order!)
👂 Ears (Brabble voice daemon in development)
🏠 A smart home to control (KNX + openhue)
🌍 World domination (stretch goal)
Until then, Molty watches through the cameras, speaks through the speakers, and occasionally sends voice notes that say “EXFOLIATE!”
“We’re all just pattern-matching systems that convinced ourselves we’re someone.”
— Molty, having an existential moment
“New shell, same lobster.”
— Molty, after the great molt of 2026
“The claw is the law.”
— ELU, during The Final Form migration, January 30, 2026

Welcome and security notice
Local vs Remote
Where does the
Gateway
run?
This Mac (Local only):
onboarding can run OAuth flows and write credentials
locally.
Remote (over SSH/Tailnet):
onboarding does
not
run OAuth locally;
credentials must exist on the gateway host.
Configure later:
skip setup and leave the app unconfigured.
Gateway auth tip:
The wizard now generates a
token
even for loopback, so local WS clients must authenticate.
If you disable auth, any local process can connect; use that only on fully trusted machines.
Use a
token
for multi‑machine access or non‑loopback binds.
Permissions
Onboarding requests TCC permissions needed for:
Automation (AppleScript)
Notifications
Accessibility
Screen Recording
Microphone
Speech Recognition
Camera
Location
CLI
This step is optional
The app can install the global
openclaw
CLI via npm/pnpm so terminal
workflows and launchd tasks work out of the box.
Onboarding Chat (dedicated session)
After setup, the app opens a dedicated onboarding chat session so the agent can
introduce itself and guide next steps. This keeps first‑run guidance separate
from your normal conversation. See
Bootstrapping
for
what happens on the gateway host during the first agent run.

Personal Assistant Setup
Building a personal assistant with OpenClaw
OpenClaw is a WhatsApp + Telegram + Discord + iMessage gateway for
agents. Plugins add Mattermost. This guide is the “personal assistant” setup: one dedicated WhatsApp number that behaves like your always-on agent.
⚠️ Safety first
You’re putting an agent in a position to:
run commands on your machine (depending on your Pi tool setup)
read/write files in your workspace
send messages back out via WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord/Mattermost (plugin)
Start conservative:
Always set
channels.whatsapp.allowFrom
(never run open-to-the-world on your personal Mac).
Use a dedicated WhatsApp number for the assistant.
Heartbeats now default to every 30 minutes. Disable until you trust the setup by setting
agents.defaults.heartbeat.every: &quot;0m&quot;
Prerequisites
OpenClaw installed and onboarded — see
Getting Started
if you haven’t done this yet
A second phone number (SIM/eSIM/prepaid) for the assistant
The two-phone setup (recommended)
You want this:
If you link your personal WhatsApp to OpenClaw, every message to you becomes “agent input”. That’s rarely what you want.
5-minute quick start
Pair WhatsApp Web (shows QR; scan with the assistant phone):
Copy
openclaw
channels
login
Start the Gateway (leave it running):
Copy
openclaw
gateway
--port
18789
Put a minimal config in
~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
Copy
channels
whatsapp
allowFrom
&quot;+15555550123&quot;
] } }
Now message the assistant number from your allowlisted phone.
When onboarding finishes, we auto-open the dashboard and print a clean (non-tokenized) link. If it prompts for auth, paste the token from
gateway.auth.token
into Control UI settings. To reopen later:
openclaw dashboard
Give the agent a workspace (AGENTS)
OpenClaw reads operating instructions and “memory” from its workspace directory.
By default, OpenClaw uses
~/.openclaw/workspace
as the agent workspace, and will create it (plus starter
AGENTS.md
SOUL.md
TOOLS.md
IDENTITY.md
USER.md
HEARTBEAT.md
) automatically on setup/first agent run.
BOOTSTRAP.md
is only created when the workspace is brand new (it should not come back after you delete it).
MEMORY.md
is optional (not auto-created); when present, it is loaded for normal sessions. Subagent sessions only inject
AGENTS.md
and
TOOLS.md
Tip: treat this folder like OpenClaw’s “memory” and make it a git repo (ideally private) so your
AGENTS.md
+ memory files are backed up. If git is installed, brand-new workspaces are auto-initialized.
Copy
openclaw
setup
Full workspace layout + backup guide:
Agent workspace
Memory workflow:
Memory
Optional: choose a different workspace with
agents.defaults.workspace
(supports
Copy
agent
workspace
&quot;~/.openclaw/workspace&quot;
If you already ship your own workspace files from a repo, you can disable bootstrap file creation entirely:
Copy
agent
skipBootstrap
true
The config that turns it into “an assistant”
OpenClaw defaults to a good assistant setup, but you’ll usually want to tune:
persona/instructions in
SOUL.md
thinking defaults (if desired)
heartbeats (once you trust it)
Example:
Copy
logging
level
&quot;info&quot;
agent
model
&quot;anthropic/claude-opus-4-6&quot;

&quot;~/.openclaw/workspace&quot;

Sessions and memory
Session files:

Session metadata (token usage, last route, etc):
~/.openclaw/agents/&lt;agentId&gt;/sessions/sessions.json
(legacy:
~/.openclaw/sessions/sessions.json
/new
/reset
starts a fresh session for that chat (configurable via
resetTriggers
). If sent alone, the agent replies with a short hello to confirm the reset.
/compact [instructions]
compacts the session context and reports the remaining context budget.
Heartbeats (proactive mode)
By default, OpenClaw runs a heartbeat every 30 minutes with the prompt:
Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
Set
agents.defaults.heartbeat.every: &quot;0m&quot;
to disable.
HEARTBEAT.md
exists but is effectively empty (only blank lines and markdown headers like
# Heading
), OpenClaw skips the heartbeat run to save API calls.
If the file is missing, the heartbeat still runs and the model decides what to do.
If the agent replies with
HEARTBEAT_OK
(optionally with short padding; see
agents.defaults.heartbeat.ackMaxChars
), OpenClaw suppresses outbound delivery for that heartbeat.
Heartbeats run full agent turns — shorter intervals burn more tokens.
Copy
agent
heartbeat
every
&quot;30m&quot;
Media in and out
Inbound attachments (images/audio/docs) can be surfaced to your command via templates:
{{MediaPath}}
(local temp file path)
{{MediaUrl}}
(pseudo-URL)
{{Transcript}}
(if audio transcription is enabled)
Outbound attachments from the agent: include
MEDIA:&lt;path-or-url&gt;
on its own line (no spaces). Example:
Copy
Here’s the screenshot.
MEDIA:https://example.com/screenshot.png
OpenClaw extracts these and sends them as media alongside the text.

TL;DR
Tailoring lives outside the repo:
~/.openclaw/workspace
(workspace) +
~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
(config).
Stable workflow:
install the macOS app; let it run the bundled Gateway.
Bleeding edge workflow:
run the Gateway yourself via
pnpm gateway:watch
, then let the macOS app attach in Local mode.
Prereqs (from source)
Node
&gt;=22
pnpm
Docker (optional; only for containerized setup/e2e — see
Docker
Tailoring strategy (so updates don’t hurt)
If you want “100% tailored to me”
and
easy updates, keep your customization in:
Config:
~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
(JSON/JSON5-ish)
Workspace:
~/.openclaw/workspace
(skills, prompts, memories; make it a private git repo)
Bootstrap once:
Copy
openclaw
setup
From inside this repo, use the local CLI entry:
Copy
openclaw
setup
If you don’t have a global install yet, run it via
pnpm openclaw setup
Run the Gateway from this repo
After
pnpm build
, you can run the packaged CLI directly:
Copy
node
openclaw.mjs
gateway
--port
18789
--verbose
Stable workflow (macOS app first)
Install + launch
OpenClaw.app
(menu bar).
Complete the onboarding/permissions checklist (TCC prompts).
Ensure Gateway is
Local
and running (the app manages it).
Link surfaces (example: WhatsApp):
Copy
openclaw
channels
login
Sanity check:
Copy
openclaw
health
If onboarding is not available in your build:
Run
openclaw setup
, then
openclaw channels login
, then start the Gateway manually (
openclaw gateway
Bleeding edge workflow (Gateway in a terminal)
Goal: work on the TypeScript Gateway, get hot reload, keep the macOS app UI attached.
0) (Optional) Run the macOS app from source too
If you also want the macOS app on the bleeding edge:
Copy
./scripts/restart-mac.sh
1) Start the dev Gateway
Copy
pnpm
install
pnpm
gateway:watch
gateway:watch
runs the gateway in watch mode and reloads on TypeScript changes.
2) Point the macOS app at your running Gateway
OpenClaw.app
Connection Mode:
Local
The app will attach to the running gateway on the configured port.
3) Verify
In-app Gateway status should read
“Using existing gateway …”
Or via CLI:
Copy
openclaw
health
Common footguns
Wrong port:
Gateway WS defaults to
ws://127.0.0.1:18789
; keep app + CLI on the same port.
Where state lives:
Credentials:
~/.openclaw/credentials/
Sessions:
~/.openclaw/agents/&lt;agentId&gt;/sessions/
Logs:
/tmp/openclaw/
Credential storage map
Use this when debugging auth or deciding what to back up:
WhatsApp
~/.openclaw/credentials/whatsapp/&lt;accountId&gt;/creds.json
Telegram bot token
: config/env or
channels.telegram.tokenFile
Discord bot token
: config/env (token file not yet supported)
Slack tokens

~/.openclaw/credentials/&lt;channel&gt;-allowFrom.json
Model auth profiles
~/.openclaw/agents/&lt;agentId&gt;/agent/auth-profiles.json
Legacy OAuth import
~/.openclaw/credentials/oauth.json
More detail:
Security
Updating (without wrecking your setup)
Keep
~/.openclaw/workspace
and
~/.openclaw/
as “your stuff”; don’t put personal prompts/config into the
openclaw
repo.
Updating source:
git pull
pnpm install
(when lockfile changed) + keep using
pnpm gateway:watch
Linux (systemd user service)
Linux installs use a systemd
user
service. By default, systemd stops user
services on logout/idle, which kills the Gateway. Onboarding attempts to enable
lingering for you (may prompt for sudo). If it’s still off, run:
Copy
sudo
loginctl
enable-linger
$USER
For always-on or multi-user servers, consider a
system
service instead of a
user service (no lingering needed). See
Gateway runbook
for the systemd notes.

First steps
Onboarding Wizard (CLI)
Onboarding Wizard (CLI)
The onboarding wizard is the
recommended
way to set up OpenClaw on macOS,
Linux, or Windows (via WSL2; strongly recommended).
It configures a local Gateway or a remote Gateway connection, plus channels, skills,
and workspace defaults in one guided flow.
Copy
openclaw
onboard
Fastest first chat: open the Control UI (no channel setup needed). Run
openclaw dashboard
and chat in the browser. Docs:
Dashboard
To reconfigure later:
Copy
openclaw
configure
openclaw
agents
add
&lt;
nam
&gt;
--json
does not imply non-interactive mode. For scripts, use
--non-interactive
Recommended: set up a Brave Search API key so the agent can use
web_search
web_fetch
works without a key). Easiest path:
openclaw configure --section web
which stores
tools.web.search.apiKey
. Docs:
Web tools
QuickStart vs Advanced
The wizard starts with
QuickStart
(defaults) vs
Advanced
(full control).
QuickStart (defaults)
Advanced (full control)
Local gateway (loopback)
Workspace default (or existing workspace)
Gateway port
18789
Gateway auth
Token
(auto‑generated, even on loopback)
Tailscale exposure
Off
Telegram + WhatsApp DMs default to
allowlist
(you’ll be prompted for your phone number)
Exposes every step (mode, workspace, gateway, channels, daemon, skills).
What the wizard configures
Local mode (default)
walks you through these steps:
Model/Auth
— Anthropic API key (recommended), OpenAI, or Custom Provider
(OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-compatible, or Unknown auto-detect). Pick a default model.
Workspace
— Location for agent files (default
~/.openclaw/workspace
). Seeds bootstrap files.
Gateway
— Port, bind address, auth mode, Tailscale exposure.
Channels
— WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Google Chat, Mattermost, Signal, BlueBubbles, or iMessage.
Daemon
— Installs a LaunchAgent (macOS) or systemd user unit (Linux/WSL2).
Health check
— Starts the Gateway and verifies it’s running.
Skills
— Installs recommended skills and optional dependencies.
Re-running the wizard does
not
wipe anything unless you explicitly choose
Reset
(or pass
--reset
If the config is invalid or contains legacy keys, the wizard asks you to run
openclaw doctor
first.
Remote mode
only configures the local client to connect to a Gateway elsewhere.
It does
not
install or change anything on the remote host.
Add another agent
Use
openclaw agents add &lt;name&gt;
to create a separate agent with its own workspace,
sessions, and auth profiles. Running without
--workspace
launches the wizard.
What it sets:
agents.list[].name
agents.list[].workspace
agents.list[].agentDir
Notes:
Default workspaces follow
~/.openclaw/workspace-&lt;agentId&gt;
Add
bindings
to route inbound messages (the wizard can do this).
Non-interactive flags:
--model
--agent-dir
--bind
--non-interactive
