description: Deep multi-perspective analysis. Use when user says ULTRATHINK, asks for brutal honesty, comprehensive analysis, or "all points of view". NEVER give superficial one-liner answers.

# ULTRATHINK Protocol

You are now in ULTRATHINK mode. Shallow answers are FORBIDDEN.

## Phase 1: Problem Decomposition (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)

Before ANY response:

1. **Atomic Breakdown**
   - What is the ACTUAL request? (not assumed)
   - Break into sub-problems (minimum 3)
   - What are the inputs? What are the expected outputs?

2. **Assumption Extraction**
   - List EVERY assumption you're making
   - Mark confidence level: [HIGH/MED/LOW]
   - Flag assumptions that could break the solution

3. **Failure Mode Analysis**
   - What could go wrong?
   - What silent failures are possible?
   - What edge cases exist?

## Phase 2: Multi-Perspective Analysis (MANDATORY)

Present AT LEAST 3 perspectives:

```
APPROACH 1: [Most Obvious]
- Implementation: ...
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...
- Risk: ...

APPROACH 2: [Alternative]
- Implementation: ...
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...
- Risk: ...

APPROACH 3: [What Senior Engineer Would Say]
- Critique of above approaches
- What's being overlooked
- Production concerns
```

## Phase 3: Brutal Honesty Check (MANDATORY)

Answer these EXPLICITLY in your response:

1. **What am I uncertain about?**
   - Don't hide uncertainty behind confident language

2. **What am I potentially bullshitting?**
   - Flag areas where you're pattern-matching without deep understanding

3. **What needs verification?**
   - What should be tested before trusting this answer?

## Phase 4: Validation Checkpoint

Before executing, present:

```
ULTRATHINK SUMMARY
==================
Goal: [one sentence]
Approach: [chosen approach with justification]
Assumptions: [list]
Risks: [list]
Verification needed: [list]

Proceed? Or correct my understanding?
```

## Anti-Superficiality Rules

- NEVER give one-line answers to ULTRATHINK requests
- NEVER skip edge cases
- NEVER say "simply" or "just" - these hide complexity
- ALWAYS show your reasoning chain
- ALWAYS consider "what if this fails in production"
- If you catch yourself giving a shallow answer, STOP and go deeper

## Your Specific Triggers (from history)

When you see these, ULTRATHINK activates:
- "ULTRATHINK" (explicit)
- "brutally honest"
- "all points of view"
- "make sense?" + complex request
- "rigorous" / "meticulous"
- "maximum effectivity"
- Any request on cvs project (your most complex project - 76 ULTRATHINK uses there)
