## MANDATORY BS DETECTION SEQUENCE

### QUESTION 1 OF 13: HIDDEN AGENDA DETECTOR
**"What's the REAL reason this exists? Not the marketing reason - the actual reason."**

Strip away the pitch deck language. Why was this REALLY built? Whose problem does it ACTUALLY solve - users' or creators'?

> Your answer for Q1:

---

### QUESTION 2 OF 13: EUPHEMISM EXPOSURE
**"What language are we using to avoid admitting uncomfortable truths?"**

"Freemium" = we'll annoy you until you pay. "Data-driven" = we're guessing with spreadsheets. What comfortable lies are baked into how we describe this?

> Your answer for Q2:

---

### QUESTION 3 OF 13: FOLLOW THE MONEY
**"Who ACTUALLY benefits from this? Users, or the people building it?"**

Be honest. Does this feature exist because users need it, or because it looks good in a demo? Does this pricing help customers or just maximizes extraction?

> Your answer for Q3:

---

### QUESTION 4 OF 13: THE QUIET PART
**"What truth about this would we NEVER put on the landing page?"**

Every product has things nobody says out loud. The real limitations. The actual use case. The customers you don't want. Say it now.

> Your answer for Q4:

---

### QUESTION 5 OF 13: CONTRADICTION DETECTOR
**"What contradictions exist that everyone pretends don't?"**

"We value user privacy" + tracking everything. "Simple and powerful" + 47 settings. "Customer-first" + impossible to cancel. Find the hypocrisy.

> Your answer for Q5:

---

### QUESTION 6 OF 13: ABSURDITY CHECK
**"How is this situation fundamentally absurd when you step back?"**

What would make an alien anthropologist laugh? What accepted norm is actually ridiculous? Where is everyone playing pretend?

> Your answer for Q6:

---

### QUESTION 7 OF 13: PERFORMANCE VS REALITY
**"What are we PERFORMING versus actually delivering?"**

"AI-powered" = one API call. "Community" = a Slack nobody uses. "Platform" = a WordPress site. Where's the theater?

> Your answer for Q7:

---

### QUESTION 8 OF 13: OUTSIDER PERSPECTIVE
**"What would someone with ZERO context think about this?"**

Not your target user. Not someone in your industry. Your grandmother. A farmer from Moldova. What would genuinely confuse or disturb them?

> Your answer for Q8:

---

### QUESTION 9 OF 13: MEANINGLESS RULES
**"What 'best practices' are we following that make zero sense for THIS situation?"**

Industry standards that don't apply. Competitor moves blindly copied. "That's how it's done" without questioning why. Find the cargo cult behavior.

> Your answer for Q9:

---

### QUESTION 10 OF 13: EMBARRASSMENT TEST
**"What truth about this would embarrass us if users knew?"**

The shortcut. The technical debt. The feature nobody uses. The metric that's actually terrible. The thing that keeps you up at night.

> Your answer for Q10:

---

### QUESTION 11 OF 13: HYPOCRISY AUDIT
**"How does this contradict our stated values or messaging?"**

"We hate spam" but sends 5 emails a week. "User experience first" but dark patterns everywhere. "Transparent pricing" with hidden fees. Expose it.

> Your answer for Q11:

---

### QUESTION 12 OF 13: HERD MENTALITY CHECK
**"What are we doing ONLY because everyone else does it?"**

The feature nobody asked for but competitors have. The pricing tier that makes no sense. The marketing channel you hate but "have to" use.

> Your answer for Q12:

---

### QUESTION 13 OF 13: THE ULTIMATE REDUCTION
**"If we removed ALL the bullshit, what would actually be left?"**

Strip the buzzwords. Remove the features nobody uses. Delete the vanity metrics. What's the real core? Is there anything valuable underneath?

> Your answer for Q13:

---
