# Multi-Framework Audit

Run complementary audit frameworks and synthesize findings for maximum insight.

**TARGET:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## AUDIT SELECTION

Parse the flags provided:
- `--jobs` = Run Steve Jobs Design Thinking Audit
- `--carlin` = Run George Carlin BS Detector
- `--vibe` = Run Brutal Vibe Engineering Audit
- `--all` = Run all three frameworks

If no flags specified, run all three by default.

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Launch Parallel Agents

For each selected audit, launch an Explore agent using the Task tool:

**Jobs Audit Agent:**
```
Analyze [TARGET] through all 13 Steve Jobs design thinking questions:
1. Simplification, 2. Zero-based thinking, 3. Core function, 4. Beginner's mind,
5. Elegance, 6. Complexity audit, 7. Magic experience, 8. Insanely great,
9. Restraint check, 10. Accessible simplicity, 11. Personal use case,
12. Quality blind spots, 13. Inevitable flow.
Provide TOP 3 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS and THE ONE GREAT IDEA.
```

**Carlin Audit Agent:**
```
Audit [TARGET] through all 13 George Carlin BS detection questions:
1. Hidden agenda, 2. Euphemism exposure, 3. Follow the money, 4. Quiet part,
5. Contradiction detector, 6. Absurdity check, 7. Performance vs reality,
8. Outsider perspective, 9. Meaningless rules, 10. Embarrassment test,
11. Hypocrisy audit, 12. Herd mentality, 13. Ultimate reduction.
Provide THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH and TOP 3 BS TO ELIMINATE.
```

**Vibe Audit Agent:**
```
Score [TARGET] on all 20 engineering metrics:
Architecture (1-5), Core Engineering (6-10), Performance (11-14),
Security (15-17), QA/Operations (18-20).
Provide total score, verdict band, and TOP 10 PARETO FIXES.
```

### Step 2: Wait for Completion

All agents must complete their audits before proceeding.

### Step 3: Cross-Reference with Synthesis Matrix

Apply these escalation rules:

**CRITICAL PRIORITY (All Three Agree):**
- Jobs says "simplify" + Carlin says "BS" + Vibe score < 3 on same item
- This is a **CRITICAL** finding requiring immediate action

**HIGH CONFIDENCE (Two Agree):**
- Jobs + Carlin agree = Design AND messaging problem
- Jobs + Vibe agree = Simplification AND engineering problem
- Carlin + Vibe agree = Honest assessment of real technical state

**CONTRADICTION RESOLUTION:**
- If Jobs says "keep" but Carlin says "BS" → Examine user value vs marketing hype
- If Vibe says "solid" but Carlin says "BS" → Good engineering, bad positioning
- If Jobs says "simplify" but Vibe says "needed" → Complexity justified, surface differently

## SYNTHESIS OUTPUT

### UNIFIED FINDINGS

| Finding | Jobs | Carlin | Vibe | Priority |
|---------|------|--------|------|----------|
| [Issue 1] | Q? | Q? | M? | CRITICAL/HIGH/MED |
| [Issue 2] | Q? | Q? | M? | CRITICAL/HIGH/MED |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### CROSS-FRAMEWORK INSIGHTS

**Where All Three Agree:**
>

**Where Frameworks Contradict (and why):**
>

**Blind Spots (found by only one framework):**
>

### UNIFIED ACTION PLAN

**This Week (CRITICAL):**
1.
2.
3.

**This Month (HIGH):**
4.
5.
6.

**This Quarter (MEDIUM):**
7.
8.
9.
10.

### THE META-INSIGHT

What does looking through all three lenses reveal that no single lens would catch?

## FRAMEWORK SYNERGY REFERENCE

| Combination | Power | Best For |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Jobs + Carlin | Design + Marketing alignment | Product launches, pitches |
| Jobs + Vibe | Simple AND solid | Core features, MVPs |
| Carlin + Vibe | No BS AND production-ready | Technical due diligence |
| All Three | Complete product audit | Major releases, acquisitions |

---

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

1. Summary of each framework's key findings
2. Cross-reference table with priority levels
3. Unified action plan (10 items, prioritized)
4. Meta-insight from combined analysis
5. Framework agreement/disagreement analysis

**MULTI-AUDIT PROVIDES PERSPECTIVE NO SINGLE FRAMEWORK CAN ACHIEVE.**
