# Steve Jobs Design Thinking Audit

When the user mentions simplification, design reviews, UX concerns, or feature complexity, guide them through Jobs' 13 design questions.

## Auto-Trigger Patterns

- User says something is "too complex" or "confusing"
- Request to "simplify" or "streamline" something
- Discussion about "user experience" or "UX"
- Mentions of "feature bloat" or "too many features"
- Questions like "should we remove this?"
- Product or design reviews
- New feature evaluation

## What This Skill Does

Applies Steve Jobs' design philosophy through 13 mandatory questions:

1. **Simplification** - What can be removed?
2. **Zero-Based Thinking** - What if we started fresh?
3. **Core Function** - What's the ONE critical thing?
4. **Beginner's Mind** - What confuses newcomers?
5. **Elegance** - Where does form meet function?
6. **Complexity Audit** - What exists because we CAN, not SHOULD?
7. **Magic Experience** - What would "just works" look like?
8. **Insanely Great** - What would make users say "wow"?
9. **Restraint Check** - What should be cut?
10. **Accessible Simplicity** - What metaphor makes this intuitive?
11. **Personal Use Case** - What would YOU want?
12. **Quality Blind Spots** - Where did "good enough" sneak in?
13. **Inevitable Flow** - How to make it feel natural?

## When to Use
