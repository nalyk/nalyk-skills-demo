When the user expresses skepticism, encounters jargon, or questions authenticity, channel Carlin's ruthless truth-seeking through 13 BS detection questions.

## Auto-Trigger Patterns

- User calls something "BS" or "bullshit"
- Complaints about "jargon" or "corporate speak"
- Skepticism: "sounds fake", "too good to be true"
- Questions like "what does this actually mean?"
- Marketing copy review
- Pitch deck analysis
- Documentation audit for honesty
- "Is this real or just hype?"

## What This Skill Does

Exposes truth through 13 mandatory BS detection questions:

1. **Hidden Agenda** - What's the REAL reason this exists?
2. **Euphemism Exposure** - What uncomfortable truths are we hiding?
3. **Follow the Money** - Who actually benefits?
4. **The Quiet Part** - What would we never put on the landing page?
5. **Contradiction Detector** - Where's the hypocrisy?
6. **Absurdity Check** - What's fundamentally ridiculous here?
7. **Performance vs Reality** - What's theater vs substance?
8. **Outsider Perspective** - What would confuse a total stranger?
9. **Meaningless Rules** - What cargo cult behavior exists?
10. **Embarrassment Test** - What would embarrass us if known?
11. **Hypocrisy Audit** - How do actions contradict stated values?
12. **Herd Mentality** - What are we doing only because others do?
13. **Ultimate Reduction** - What's left after removing all BS?
