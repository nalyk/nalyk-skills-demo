4. Identify dead-end pages (no outgoing links)
5. Detect keyword cannibalization (>60% title/H1 similarity)
6. Suggest missing internal links based on content relevance
7. Analyze link equity distribution

## Output Format

- PageRank distribution (top 10, bottom 10)
- Orphan pages list
- Dead-end pages list
- Cannibalization pairs with similarity scores
